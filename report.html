<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> The snow continues to consistently fall, giving the trails a nice boost of softness for today’s skiers and riders. Looking at the radar it appears we are definitely in for more of the same throughout the rest of the day. Tomorrow is looking to be a pleasant sunny day, and the groomers will be delicious with a nice refresh from Mother Nature.</p>
<p>The snowmakers today were out and about getting production going on the family favorite Scoot. Next, they will head back up to fire things up on West Mountain and Sidewinder. I got a chance to catch up with the STP crew and they are hoping to have Stomping Grounds ready for jibbin’ on Monday. Tonight the grooming team will hit the hill and aim to groom all of our open terrains for Saturday’s shred fest.</p>
<p>Looking into tonight, the snow persists into the evening. As snow wraps up temperatures take tumble down into the single digits at the base and winds begin to ramp up at the exit of this storm. Tomorrow things warm up slightly with full sun and temps in the mid-teens and winds remain on the strong side blowing in the 20-50mph range. Once wind speeds start hitting that 50mph and above is when lift operations can start to get iffy, but it all has to do with the intensity of the gusts and the direction of the wind. I would put it as a slight possibility to see some wind holds tomorrow. We’ll keep you updated right here on the Mountain Report early tomorrow morning with all observations and lift statuses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
