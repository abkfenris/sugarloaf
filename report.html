<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The Pond Skim Championships was as always, a complete spectacle of determination and courage. Men, women, and children alike faced the reality of not making the distance and submitting themselves to the tortures of 40-degree water with equipment attached to their feet. If I were to wager a guess about half of the competitors made it across. There were even a few snow riders performing flips and different stunts exiting the pool. Tonight the grooming team will hit the hill and prepare an array of corduroy for tomorrow morning’s early bird delights. Tomorrow marks the last day of the King Pine Lift operations for the season. So make sure to celebrate and give it a proper send-off. To check the late-season lift schedule <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/spring-operations-schedule">click here</a>.<br/>The weather tonight calls for cooling temperatures with rain showers that could turn to snow during the overnight hours. It is possible we can see 1-3 inches of accumulation for tomorrow's skiing and riding. Sunday night the weather blows out with the possibilities of more mixed precipitation, as we look at a sunny beautiful day for Sunday with temperatures reaching the upper 40s. Tuesday is looking to bring some potential for some late-season pow riding. It is still too early and late at the same time to get all hot and bothered about but definitely something to keep an eye on over the coming days.</p>
<p>Stay Tuned,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
