<p><strong>UPDATE 11:41AM - Winds are impacting lift operations today.  Please check live lift report below for details.</strong></p>
<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>It’s another beautiful day at Sugarloaf.  The moonlight lit up the whole sky on the way in this morning and the wind is still blowing steady.  More or less the same weather as yesterday with a slight drop in temperature.  Feels warm but the wind chill definitely plays a factor.</p>
<p>Temperatures at the base and top measure 23 and 13 degrees respectively.  Wind will play a factor again today.  This mornings’ wind speeds from the northwest read nearly as high as yesterdays’.  Pockets of sun should shine through as clouds are moving with haste overhead.  However, it is likely to calm slightly throughout the day.</p>
<p>Last night the grooming team was able to be out there in greater capacity than the past few nights.  A lot of spots that had become puddles are now hardening up and it’s their honorable duty to buff as much of that to flat as they can.  On the bright side, it should lead to some hard and fast conditions that many of the Nationals racers may find favorable. </p>
<p>We are still proudly claiming 97 trails, 468 acres or 42 miles of terrain.  Our 7 scheduled lifts today include SuperQuad, Skyline, Skidway, Snubber and DoubleRunner at 8:30am followed by Whiffletree and King Pine at 9:00am.  I’m getting word now that Skyline will start the day on wind hold due to gusts over 60mph.  For freestyle action we have four parks in operation including Spurline, Stomping Grounds, Sidewinder and Dropline. </p>
<p>Looking further ahead in the week we are closely monitoring a storm that will likely arrive Thursday bringing 3-5 inches of snow!  Chance for precipitation remains high through the weekend so we may end up seeing a mix of rain and snow Friday, followed by potentially another inch or two on Saturday/Sunday.  Very exciting.</p>
<p>As for today, let’s go fast and have fun.</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
