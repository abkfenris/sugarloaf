<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>This morning was a pleasant surprise as there was hardly a in the cloud in the sky and it’s been getting warmer every hour.  Snow teams must be doing an amazing job while we’re all asleep because the groomed stuff is so fun to dig into right now and the mountain was just so enjoyable today. </p>
<p>As I’m writing this, we are yet to see any of that snowfall I mentioned, but we should see those clouds accumulating here with some light droppings in the next few hours and continuing until around midnight.  Temps tonight will remain cool: 16-20 degrees with SSE/NW 10-16 mph winds at the base and 7-11 degrees with WSW/W 25-40 mph winds at top.  Snow accumulation will be no more than an inch or two. </p>
<p>Tomorrow’s forecast shows a very similar weather pattern to today with just a slight increase in both temperature and wind.  At the base, temperatures will reach 24-28 degrees with NW/WNW 14-20mph winds.  At the top, 14-18 degrees with WNW/W 25-45 mph winds.  Our forecast is showing mostly cloudy (but that’s what I said today and it was majorly blue-bird). </p>
<p>Grooming tonight plans to smooth out White Nitro Extension and they’re going to hit Gondi Line Extension again which should be sweet if we get a couple inches.  The rest of their weeknight routine is also scheduled for grooming.  Timberline should be back and running tomorrow along with King Pine and Whiffletree at 9:00am.  Superquad, Skyline, Snubber and Skidway will open per usual at 8:30am.  First tracks in the morning will definitely include some really primed groomers and some with that little bit of untouched fresh stuff.  Get here!</p>
<p>Looking further ahead in the week – we’re still seeing a chance for some light snowfall Thursday morning.  The forecast other than that is more or less cool and calm.  A calm week weather-wise almost seems fitting after the chaos of Feb break and the variable forms of precipitation we’ve experienced.  However we are always praying for snow as we’re keeping an eye on a complex mixed precipitation system likely to hit this area around March 7<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Speculation aside, I can assuredly say it’s a great week to be a Sugarloafer.  Don’t forget to check back in tomorrow with our most tenured reporter Chris.  I can’t wait to write for you all again soon, see you next week.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
