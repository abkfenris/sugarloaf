<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>And what a happy Saturday it is. Taking a gander at the radar this morning would lighten the heart of the most bah of humbugs. With snow beginning to fall later in the morning and only increasing in intensity throughout the day, plus receiving reports of winds 15-20mph at the top of Skyline. Today is shaping up to be perhaps one of the dandiest of days of 2022.</p>
<p>Last night the grooming department set off to brush up all of our piste terrains except for Skidder. The snowmaking team is going to enjoy watching somebody else do the work while enjoying a PBR. Today we will see the Sidewinder Boarder Cross Park open to the public, so gather your pals and see about who the best is, and remember “there are no points for second place.”</p>
<p>The weather today and tonight calls for snow and lots of it. Temps are around 10 degrees with winds remaining tempered in the 15-35mph range, most likely allowing for full lift operations today. Our weather reports are still showing the possibility of 11-17” of total snow by the time this thing is all said and done. So get your shovel ready, gas up the snowblower, and wax up the skis because we got a good old fashion Nor’easter knocking on our front door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Live it up,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
