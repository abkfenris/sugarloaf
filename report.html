<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> Happy Friday everybody. Today is looking to be the calm before the storm. Recent snowfall, cold air, and the continual efforts of the grooming squad have made for some model early season conditions. Today is the day to grab your most dependable ski buddy and come see us for some of the best snow sliding around.  </p>
<p>The Mountain Ops crew was again busy working all night to give us the best skiing and riding experience as possible. The groomers were out freshening up all of our 116 acres of available terrain, plus working on getting Hayburner ready for the shredy. The snowmakers were also active in the wee hours, maintaining operations on Windrow, Boardwalk, Lower Scoot, Slasher, and a few guns adding the finishing touches on The Birches.</p>
<p>The weather today is calling for a slight rise in temperatures to the 20’s at the base and low teens at the summit. Wind is also expected to increase today with winds around 25-35mph. Skies will be mostly cloudy, with a chance of a few passing snow showers totaling another inch of snow. Come enjoy the calm before the storm.</p>
<p> See you in the afternoon,</p>
<p> Chris</p>
