<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Full sun and premier conditions are proving to be the antidote to long weeks of work in the office. The energy was radiant, and despite cold temperatures. I saw plenty of exposed smiles framed with rosy cheeks. We have made it through the darkest part of winter, now we just got to ski our way through the coldest. However, this cold has been preserving the snow extremely well and the lower angle off-piste is skiing really well. If you get a chance, head on over to Boomauger for a run. The bumps are small and soft with minimal whip-its sticking through.</p>
<p>Snowmaking tonight will continue operations on Gondi Line, Dropline, and Timberline. With ideal conditions afoot. The snow can pile up fast and sometimes make some interesting sculptures like depicted on our Facebook page or that you saw at the bottom of Lombard Cross Cut today. Tonight the grooming department has a full list to accomplish and will set out to groom all of the usual suspects from West Mountain to Haulback overnight. Remember to check below in the mornings to catch up and see if your favorite trail was groomed.</p>
<p>The weather overnight remains consistent with what we saw today with temperatures only slightly dipping. Clouds move in and bring a chance of light snow showers for tomorrow. Sunday brings warmer temperatures with highs around 22 at the base and winds at a moderate 20-30mph. Although it appears the sun goes away for tomorrow we are always happy to receive a little bit of snow, and when we do see the sun again it will just be that much higher over the summit of Sugarloaf.</p>
<p>Enjoy your night,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
