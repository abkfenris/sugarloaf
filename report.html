<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Much of what had been liquid and wet the past few days is starting to harden up today.  There was a chilly breeze that led to a bit more granular of a surface out there.  The mountain was pretty dang fun today, but after a few days of this warmth not allowing for normal grooming operations, you really start to appreciate what those fine ladies and gentleman do up there in the cats every night.</p>
<p>We had some wind holds today.  Timberline was a no go from start of day, King pine didn’t run today either but Skyline opened just behind schedule to run for a full day.  The U.S. Nationals athletes had some practice and qualifying runs scheduled for today but wind and conditions was enough cause to postpone a day. </p>
<p>Tonight, temperatures should drop into the teens which should be enough for the both grooming shifts to operate – getting more uniform coverage across the mountain.  We’re still waiting to get more definitive word on some trail closure decisions being made today, but there will be more groomed stuff than there has been the past few days getting trails like Gondi Line, Widowmaker and Flume.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we’re looking at 21-25 degrees base, 11-15 degrees top.  Winds are predicted to die off a bit; let’s hope that they drop enough for full operations.  Looking further down the stretch we have some snowfall potential Wednesday into Thursday so and don’t forget to keep dancing to the snow gods.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
