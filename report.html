<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>We are rolling into Maine February vacation week with some favorable conditions ahead.  Despite some warmth, rain, and lost terrain – warm weather and light snowfall is predicted throughout most of this vacation period.  We may not be getting any deep stuff or playing in the woods but the carving should be deep and the jumping should be soft.</p>
<p>This morning were seeing some of that pleasant warmth with temps of 36 at base and 24 at top, winds are reading a bit high with 14-20 WSW at base, 40-55 W at top, and sky cover will be partly cloudy which I find almost always translates to sunny.    </p>
<p>Snowmakers shut it down last night so no guns blowing today.  Our Groomers however hit the hill in full force to get ready for this busy week hitting their weekday routine and some.  The product is an incredible 73 trails, 390 acres of skiing, this includes our 5 parks, Boardwalk, Sidewinder, Spurline, Stomping Grounds and Upper Tote, which were all closed down and freshly touched up this weekend, and it’s all accessible via our 11 wonderful lifts, Superquad, Skyline, Double Runner East, Double Runner West, Sawduster, Skidway, Snubber and West Mountain at 8:30am, Whiffletree, King Pine and Timberline at 9:00am.</p>
<p>Everybody brace yourselves for an awesome week, be safe, and most importantly have fun!</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
