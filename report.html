<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather wasn't exactly what you like to see to kick off a new year, but the snow has been soft and the rain held off throughout the morning, and there's this saying I've heard about beggars and choosers, so we'll just say that a New Year's day with skiing is better than one without and leave it at that. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather system we've been keeping an eye on has arrived this afternoon, and we're currently seeing light rain, with steadier rain expected to move in later tonight. We should see that continue into tomorrow morning with warm temps and showers hanging on throughout the morning. Temps will come tumbling back down later in the day, and with any luck we'll wrap this whole thing up with 2-3 inches of snow Sunday evening. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of snow conditions, expect things to start off soft and soggy tomorrow morning. Groomers will be out on most of our trails overnight tonight, so look for plenty of fresh corduroy to start your day. We could see surfaces set up later in the day depending on what time temperatures drop, which could impact some of our open terrain tomorrow afternoon. Advice from this snow reporter is to wear Gore Tex and be prepared for anything if you're headed up tomorrow. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We'll have 10 lifts scheduled to spin for you again tomorrow, with the SuperQuad opening at 7:30am for our First Tracks pass holders. Winds look to be fairly mild again tomorrow and we don't expect them to cause any issues in terms of lift operations, but be sure to check in tomorrow morning for any updates. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See you out there,</p>
