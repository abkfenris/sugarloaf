<p><strong>9:30AM UPDATE: Due to a frozen water line, Bullwinkle's will not be open today.  All scheduled lifts are running. </strong></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>This week so far has been a frenzied snow globe of activity since our big storm on Monday. With an additional 3” yesterday trails are skiing great. With temperatures dropping today and the return of arctic air over the weekend today is sure looking to be the day, so grab your best pal, chap-stick, and your favorite snow riding goodies and enjoy winter and the moment here at Sugarloaf.</p>
<p>Ski Patrol has checked out all of Sugarloaf’s terrain and has opened everything with adequate snow. Be cautious of water bars and other dangers while skiing natural snow trails, hazards can present themselves at any time. However, from Glancer to Ripsaw you’ll find most of your favorite trails open with soft bumps and good coverage. The snowmakers plot their return on Friday night to blast snow on Upper Timberline, Gondi Extension, and Gondi Line. Groomers last night hit all the usual suspects except the King Pine Bowl.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for mixed sun and clouds with a possible flurry. The winds are respectable in the 25-45mph range coming from the Northwest. Which shouldn’t affect any lift operations today. Temperatures start warm in the mid 20’s then steadily creep down all day and into the night where we will see temperatures around -6 degrees at the base. Friday appears to be a beautiful sunny day with calmer winds and crisp temperatures right around 0. Rumors have started about another storm possibly hitting us next week, but things are disorganized now leaving little to decipher.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
