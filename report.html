<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today we are operating with the SuperQuad, Skyline, and Skidway; chairs will service 18 trails of early-season delight. Things are shaping up nicely, with more cold weather and snow showers on tap for today and tonight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last night, our snowmakers spread out across the hill, operating on Windrow, Hayburner, The Landing, and The Birches. Temperatures s remain cold today, allowing them to continue blasting snow throughout the day. The grooming team hit all of our open terrain overnight, freshening up 18 trails plus pushing out all the giant whales on Spillway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today's weather calls for cloudy skies with temperatures in the upper teens, light winds from the south west in the 10 to 20mph range. Look for snow showers starting after lunch, wich will continue into the night, dropping up to 2 inches by Friday morning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Join us for the annual <a href="/events-calendar/tree-lighting-festival" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tree Lighting Festival &amp; Fireworks</a> on Saturday, December 11. Do some shopping and support local vendors at the <a href="/events-calendar" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Holiday Gift Bazaar</a> in the Sugarloaf Mountain Hotel; in the spirit of the season, there will be a collection table for any food or toys to be donated to the United Methodist Economic Ministry. Embark on a horse and carriage ride down Main Street Sugarloaf, enjoy festive music on the Beach, entertainment by AudioBody, and even see Santa—that’s right, Santa Claus is coming to town! He’ll be accompanied by Amos and friends to spread holiday cheer. End the afternoon with a fireworks display for Santa’s sendoff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Something else to celebrate on Saturday, December 11: <a href="/dining/bullwinkles" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bullwinkle’s Bistro</a> will be reopening with an all-new menu for the ’21/22 season! Don’t worry, you can still order their famous Bloodies.</p>
<p>Catch you here this afternoon,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
