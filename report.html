<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We hope everyone had a wonderful weekend celebrating the holidays with family and friends, in addition to getting in some much-needed time on the mountain. Winter in New England really hits differently with crisp cold air, family, friends, and this beautiful mountain, huh? You can drop off all of my Christmas presents under the tree near Java’s<span>–</span>I’m just kidding! A new car wouldn’t fit there anyways…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The groomers are at it again, currently finishing up their morning as they get to all of the available trails we have; currently we have 36 open trails! That’s 216 acres, or 17 miles, of top-to-bottom carving and riding. The snowmakers also put in another hard night with headlamps and ice axes as they forged through the dark to get a few more of your favorite trails ready: Widowmaker, Choker, Flume, Tohaul, and Haulback are all getting the gift of snow in preparation for the coming weeks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today’s weather is looking great. The base of the mountain should stay in the high 20s with low winds and clear skies; the summit will be slightly colder with low-mid 20s and 5-10 mph winds. Clouds will arrive in the afternoon, bringing in light snow for the early hours of Tuesday, so the duster will be nice. As always, wake up warm and happy, and I hope to see you all bright and early for first chair!</p>
