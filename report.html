<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Well we never really got a chance to enjoy the mountain today due to some heavy icing that occurred overnight. Patrol hit the hill this morning to be terrified by the conditions they found. They described the whole mountain as an ice rink. Good news is now you have a great excuse to just party, enjoy some live music, and socialize with friends for the day. With warmer temps forecasted for tomorrow I'm feeling confident that we'll be able to get out there and enjoy some slush puppy turns.</p>
<p>The grooming team will hit the hill again tonight and aim to groom the same trails as last night. Including Kings Landing, Tote Road, Hayburner, Sluice, and Ramdown. Additionally they’ll cover all the terrain on the lower mountain so you can have a nice place to teach your friend or loved ones the joys of snow riding.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for diminishing showers and winds. Temperatures will hover around the freezing mark up and down the mountain. Saturday brings a warm day with temperatures reaching a high of around 50 at the base. Hopefully this will allow for all the ice to melt out that is plaguing the hill today. Tomorrow starts cloudy with the possibility of light showers in the morning. As we get to the late afternoon heavier precipitation is set to pick up again into Saturday night. Sunday appears to be slightly colder with highs in the mid 40’s at the base with isolated showers continuing for the day. Monday things appear to clear out and bring a sunny breezy day with temps reaching a high in the mid 40’s.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
