<p>Good afternoon, Sugarloafers.</p>
<p>The first of the month turned out to be a very solid one today.  I am personally enjoying some of the newly groomed trails this week and was stoked to bomb Gondi Line.  There’s some fresh natural powder leftover from this past weekend, and with more snow seemingly on the way Thursday/Friday-it’s hard not to enjoy a few mild sunny days in between.</p>
<p>Tonight the snow making squad will finish up snow-blasting on Headwall, Dropline, Spillway Crosscut, and Wedge before shutting down operations for the day tomorrow.  Simultaneously, our beloved groomers will be at it again sculpting the trails on their weekday routine tonight. </p>
<p>As for tomorrow, we’re expecting to have the same 7 lifts running.  The temperature shows warmer than today (29-33 base, 23-27 top) yet humidity will stay high and winds will pick up as this next system approaches (S 15-25 base, WSW 35-55 top). </p>
<p>With the wind comes clouds tomorrow.  Light drizzle/flurries are possible tomorrow and Thursday before dominant low pressure tracks across the region Thursday evening, beginning as mixed precipitation, and changing to snow Thursday night into Friday mid-day.  Snow amounts “may be significant” but definitely will need to watch for mixing potential.</p>
<p>Catch you right back here tomorrow morning for another update,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
