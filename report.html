<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Today just be one of those days that makes the East Coast skier spirit so strong and resilient. Those who braved wind and rain were rewarded with warm temps and spring conditions.  Despite the forecast ahead, you can bet that die-hard Sugarloafers will still be out there ripping it up with a smile enjoying the moment.</p>
<p>Another thing you can bet on is that our Mountain Operations team will be doing everything they can to help clean up whatever happens tonight. It sometimes is best for the longevity of the snow to just stay off it with heavy equipment during such weather events. We’ll have a few cats come in 2nd shift tomorrow morning to touch up some lower terrain. If things stay warm into the morning we should have more soft and spring-like conditions tomorrow.  </p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for rain and pain. Winds accelerate to the extreme category up high on Sugarloaf reaching speeds of 65 to 85mph. Rainfall totals will be around a half-inch overnight with temperatures in the upper 30’s. Tomorrow things start warm then gradually start to cool off during the day. Winds will remain strong with speeds of 25-40mph at the base and 50-70mph at the summit. Likely to affect lift operations tomorrow. Friday night temperatures plunge to the single digits. Get your skis and boards in their respective shops and get your edges ready because things are going to be sporty and fast come Saturday morning.</p>
<p> Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
