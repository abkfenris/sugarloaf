<p style="text-align: justify;">Good afternoon, Sugarloafers.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s a good day to dawn your favorite puffy coat, because—despite temperatures moderating into the upper 20s at the summit and a high of 42 degrees by the base today—baby, it’s cold outside! <o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can credit the chill to elevated winds from the WNW, which are forecasted to increase tonight, shifting to originate from the NW and strengthening for tomorrow’s turns; we expect to see sustained speeds of 55 to 70 miles per hour at higher elevation terrain on Tuesday. <strong>Please be prepared that this may impact lift operations.</strong> I know, I know, we’ve had a doozy of a couple of days, but should we see holds, you can count on us to keep that information readily available on this page as well as on our Snow Reporting Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/SugarloafSnow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@SugarloafSnow</a>, which we update regularly with need-to-know info.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Those heading to the hill tomorrow should be taking turns under partly sunny skies. Dress for temperatures in the 20s at the top with mid-to-high 30s by the base (and again, remember to factor in wind chill in your wardrobe decisions). We’ll have the same 24 trails open for tomorrow, accessible by our 5 scheduled lifts—that’s DRC B, Sawduster, Skidway, Skyline, and the SuperQuad, all scheduled to start spinning at 8:30am.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Snowmaking plans to get the guns going again on Tuesday as temperatures allow; for this window (lasting through Thursday), their work will concentrate on King's Landing, the Chicken Pitch portion of Tote Road, Boardwalk, and Lower Scoot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Wondering what’s in store for the weekend? I know, I know, it’s only Monday, but the forecast suggests we’re due for two cold fronts, the first of which arriving Friday and the second Saturday, with much colder air expected starting next Sunday. These should be some of the coldest temperatures we’ve seen yet, </span><span>which is good news for our snowmakers—after all, at this point in the season, expanding terrain is the name of the game</span><span>. Plus, we expect to have a couple of new trails ready for first tracks on Saturday... </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Also on Saturday is our annual <a href="/events-calendar/tree-lighting-festival" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tree Lighting Festival</a>—and Santa Claus will be coming to town, accompanied by Amos and friends! Come celebrate the season in Sugarloaf style with warm treats, music on the Beach, fireworks, and more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Enjoy your afternoons,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Gabrielle</span></p>
