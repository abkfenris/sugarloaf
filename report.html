<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>We should be in for a good one today folks.  Even before the snow started falling on Saturday the murmurs have been “should be great Monday”.  A lovely dump of 9 inches falling mostly on Saturday led to some well-deserved T-Bar runs early yesterday, but with the lifts majorly not running, most of this snow still needs you to rip it up.  What got groomed down will make for choice turns, and some freshies certainly await the eager beavers off the beaten path.</p>
<p>Weather this morning was pleasant on the way in.  Temps should rise from the teens all the way up into the lower 30’s today at the base, and could get as high as 21-25 degrees at the top.  High wind speeds from yesterday should subside enough for lifts to run.  It feels really calm in the parking lot this morning but wind predictions show up to 20mph at base and up to 40mph at top possible throughout the day.  Partial sunshine is also in the forecast which should keep both visibility and spirits high.</p>
<p>Last night our dedicated groomers hopped in their cats and had some material to work with.  I’m personally stoked to see that Flume, Widowmaker and Ramdown were on the grooming list – also tracking fast this morning will be freshly striped Sluice and Spillway.  I cannot wait to get out there.  All lifts are scheduled to run today with the exception of West Mountain so we should have the pleasure of Timberline and King Pine at our disposal.  I know this snow also helped our wonderful parks crew shape our 5 sick parks back to perfection -- smooth lips and soft landings.   </p>
<p>Extended forecast shows a cold front coming in tomorrow but generally it will be a warm week in the 20’s and 30’s.  Tonight and tomorrow we may see some light snow showers.  The next system we’re keeping our eyes on would hit us sometime this weekend with more details to come.  I’m just going to focus on enjoying today for now because this one has potential to be an incredible Monday.</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
