<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Rise and shine for what should be a beautiful Tuesday.  As of this morning it’s shaping up to be another warm and sunny day.  If it is to be anything like yesterday; the snow will be firm enough for cruising and carving in the morning and then soften up throughout the day.  It’s a perfect day in my book when I had just as much fun cruising groomers as I did slipping and slushing around the park.</p>
<p>Forecasted temperatures are 42-46 degrees and 28-32 degrees at the base and top respectively.  Wind shouldn’t be much of a factor today and despite some cloud cover this morning we are expecting a sunny day.  Last night our beloved grooming team got it done on most everything open to public.  Not having King Pine or Whiffletree running this week, we’ve been leaving most stuff over on the east face until the weekend besides a few to get back to SuperQuad - Ramdown, Widowmaker and Flume.  Lifts today will be the same 5 as yesterday: SuperQuad, Skyline, Snubber, Skidway and DRC East running from 8:30am on.  This also brings our official trail count down to 45 open trails.  Don't worry though because much of it will be opened back up for weekends and Reggae-Festivities.</p>
<p>As we move deeper into the spring, our lift operation schedule varies quite a bit from week to week. You can view our anticipated <a href="/spring-operations-schedule">lift operation schedule for the rest of the spring here</a>. Please keep in mind that this schedule is tentative, and subject to change based on conditions, weather, and other factors. </p>
<p>Speaking of; only TWO days away until the start of Reggae Fest.  We’re still monitoring this forecast for Thursday-Saturday precipitation; looks like it will be an amalgamation of snow/rain/mixed showers.  Today will likely be the calmest day of the week so let’s enjoy the calm before the storm.</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady  </p>
