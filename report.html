<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>It really is just nice to not be assaulted by air while snow riding. The mild temperatures and lack of wind are making for a pleasant day on the hill. With a snowstorm on track for this weekend, it appears the spirit of winter is coming to us in full swing.  </p>
<p>With only cold and snow in the forecast, conditions will only continue to improve as our grooming team gets another night to refine their work. They plan on hitting all the trails we had today plus grooming trails that were closed today due to conditions, like Gondi Line and Haulback. The Competition Crew has their work cut out for them over the coming weeks as Sugarloaf is set to host the Sugarloaf Banked Slalom Event on Sidewinder, and the U.S Alpine Championships events taking place on Narrow Gauge that will bring Olympians and a number of top athletes from the U.S Alpine Ski Team set to take place March 20<sup>th</sup> to April 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>The weather tonight brings falling temperatures and a few snow flurries. Thursday temperatures warm back up to the upper 20s as winds elevate to speeds up to 40-55mph on the summit. With winds forecasted that high on the upper mountain, it is possible for lift operations to be affected. Skies will bring a mix of sun and clouds as we begin to feel the onset of this weekend’s snowstorm. Without getting too excited indications are looking good for an all snow event Saturday. When the reports use words like “moderate to significant accumulations” and “heaviest precipitation to the mountains of Maine”. You can’t but help to get excited and consider your plans for the weekend and whether it’s okay or not to blow off responsibilities and head upta the Loaf for the weekend.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
