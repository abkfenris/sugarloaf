<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Man, it sure is nice when the sun gets in your blood on these warm pleasant afternoons. Especially when you think back to the dark weeks where temperatures hovered around 0 degrees. Sugarloaf is after all the King of Spring and tomorrow’s snowstorm will set us up nicely to maintain the title.</p>
<p>The grooming department plans to hit the hill hard tonight and focus on refining all the terrain we had available for everyone today. Additionally, they’ll tackle the big project of buffing out Haulback which currently fits the description more of an ice rink than a ski slope. Anyone who rode King Pine today will firsthand get to see the tremendous work the snowcats can accomplish in just one night.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for temps around 28 degrees at the base and increasing winds on the summit. Snow starts falling early Saturday morning and increasing in intensity just about the time lifts open, and then persists throughout the day. The bulk of the snow is forecasted to fall during our open hours tomorrow. A few inches is forecasted to fall overnight Saturday and should make for some awesome powder conditions Sunday morning.</p>
<p> Currently, we are looking at stiff South/Southeast winds ranging from 50-70mph at the summit but only 10-20mph at the base tomorrow along with the storm. Sugarloaf faces north so when we get winds out of the south sometimes the wind is blocked by the mountain and we are able to run upper mountain lifts despite the high winds. That being said I’m optimistic that we’ll have most lifts online for tomorrow, but at the same time, I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw a few wind holds. It’s up to old man winter at this point. When it doubt prepare for the worst and hope for the best.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
