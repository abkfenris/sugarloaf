<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>What a wonderful day at the King of Spring, these are the days that gave Sugarloaf this title. Although it was a little chilly at the start, it definitely led to some prime-time corn conditions this afternoon. With Mother Nature hitting the reset button for tomorrow you can be sure the spring vibes will continue at the King of Spring.</p>
<p>The grooming team tonight will hit a variety of terrain for the Sunday fun day shred fest. You can expect a few trails from the top of each lift with the possibility of a few more being thrown in there. Tomorrow we’ll continue our <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/spring-operations-schedule">spring lift operations</a> with Skyline, SuperQuad, and Double Runner.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for increasing clouds and temperatures dropping to around freezing. Tomorrow warms up quicker than today as temps hit a high in the low 50s around the base for Sunday. A few clouds will be around but expect mostly sunny skies with winds chillin’ in the 20-30mph range.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
