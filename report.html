<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Skiers and riders were treated to some dramatic skies today: clouds and snowsqualls raced by, punctuated with pockets of sun, makingfor some special moments on the hill. This Sunday, Sugarloafers were able to enjoy testing all the latest and most modern equipment from most major ski retailers, including Carrabassett Valley’s very own Winter Stick/West Mountain Ski Company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today our snowmaking team headed out on the mountain to maintain further production on Spillway, while also getting the guns fired up on Hayburner and the Birches. With things wrapping up on Spillway, the continued march of expansion will continue. Tonight the grooming machines will be cruising the slopes touching up all of our open terrain.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Weather tonight will bring us cloudy skies with moderate winds. Temperatures will remain in the low 20s at the base, allowing the snowmakers to get a final push before our next disturbance rolls in tomorrow morning. Things will warm up substantially tomorrow, with temperatures in the mid 40s by the base. Big temperatures changes usually bring big winds, and we are looking at gusts between 70 and 80 mph at the summit, with sustained winds in the 15 to 30 mph range at the base.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tomorrow morning, we expect precipitation to be either sleet or snow, then in the afternoon, they are forecasting precipitation to switch over to freezing rain. This undesirable weather holds into Monday night, finally giving way to partly sunny skies on Tuesday. Another disturbance rolling in on Wednesday is currently looking to be of the colder variety. It's been a great weekend with all you Sugarloafers, wishing you all a happy and productive week ahead.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em></p>
