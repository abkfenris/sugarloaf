<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Today is the idyllic day for our beloved fare weather snow riders. Gone are the days of zero degree temperatures and arctic winds, and in are the days of chirping birds and the Bullwinkles porch.  With competitions coming to an end and Reggae Fest just around the corner it is time to sit back relax and enjoy the sunset of the 2022 ski season.</p>
<p>Tonight the grooming team will hit the hill with a focus of getting terrain buffed out from Windrow over to Widowmaker. The snow surface today started firm, edgeable, and fast. And snow riders are now harvesting the bountiful corn crops before they turn to a slush puppy. When was the last time you had one of those?</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for increasing clouds, temperatures right around freezing and slightly elevated winds. Tomorrow starts off cloudy with warm temperatures in the 40s as low pressure builds in the area where we might see a few snow flurries or drizzles in the afternoon. Precipitation picks up significantly Thursday night with a couple of inches of snow/sleet anticipated to fall. As things progress into Friday warm air aloft turns our wintery mix into the damper variety as the storms winds down during the day Friday. Over the weekend we are likely to see a few isolated mix precipitation events, however they don’t seem to be anything to heavy as of now.</p>
<p>Now don’t let the forecast for this weekend dampen your spirit one bit because we have a wonderful line up of Reggae bands and DJs to help <em>lively up yourself</em> for this classic weekend of celebrating Jah, mountain life, and soul soothing reggae music. So <em>don’t you worry about a thing, because every little thing is gonna be alright. </em></p>
<p>Have a wonderful night,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
