<p>TFIG Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>We’ve made it through another week toiling after what is to be with this weekend’s storm. Things are looking good for us winter lovers in Carrabassett Valley. Since the storm last Monday we have increased our acreage and trail count by around 50%, and the Outdoor Center has expanded to nearly all of their available terrain for cross country skiing, snowshoeing, and fat biking. With still plenty of room to expand with this weekend’s storm, we must remind ourselves that we can’t ski the forecast and to enjoy the day whatever it might bring.</p>
<p>Last night our grooming team hit the hill and set out to expand our groomed offerings for today. With the return of King Pine and Timberline lifts you’ll find fresh corduroy on Timberline from the summit to Haulback under the King Pine lift. The building of Sidewinder is mostly wrapped up it just needs some final attention from ski patrol and the competition crew. The boarder cross park is scheduled to be open on Saturday. Drop Line Park still needs more snow production to form the large-scale features the STP has in mind.</p>
<p>Today look for cloudy skies with scattered snow showers and temperatures around 20 degrees. Winds remain moderate in the 20-40mph range. Tonight things cool down a bit where we’ll see lows around 10 degrees at the base of the mountain with slightly tapered winds and continued snow showers. Eyes then shift to what has been another humbling storm for forecasters. With multiple track shifts and dynamic variables, it’s been hard to decipher if we’ll see a widespread blizzard or a few inches of snow. Currently, things are looking very appealing from the point of view of a snow rider. So buckle up butter cup we are in for a heck of a ride this weekend.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
