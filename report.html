<p><b>SkyLine Open off Wind Hold and open to Public. -10:46am</b></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just 2 more days until Christmas arrives and just 8 days until we are staring 2022 right in the face. Can’t but help to be highly hopeful of a wonderful new year ahead filled with many friends, family, and powder days. Make sure to bring your chapstick and a positive attitude, because the temps are cold and the winds are ripping. Be prepared for the likelihood of wind holds</p>
<p>With that being said the snowmakers have been busting their butt sleds off to get all of our favorite terrain open as quickly as possible. Last night they operated on Skidder, Ramdown, and Cruiser. The groomers were out on the hill hitting all of our open terrains. Yesterday the park crew put the finishing touches on our newest park located on Boardwalk. Which is going to be a hoot for all the jibbers out there.</p>
<p>Today’s weather calls for cold and wind. Base temps are in the low teens while we see as low as zero at the summit. Winds are 30mph at the base and gusting to the 70s at the summit. Tonight calls for our first sub-zero temperatures at the summit and a low of 6 at the base. Winds slightly diminish tonight to the 25-50mph range. Make sure to check back here with us here at the mountain report or on Twitter @sugarloafsnow for all the most recent lift and trail updates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
