<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>What an exciting day of US Alpine Championships yesterday with Paula Moltzan and Jett Seymour taking home their first national titles in the Slalom event.  We now move on to Giant Slalom with Men’s National Championship runs taking place at 9:30am and 12:30pm.</p>
<p>Racing conditions should be as good as they were yesterday.  Although it’s a balmy 8 degrees atop the mountain this morning, we expect to see that rise to about 20-24 degrees midday and 32-36 degrees at the base as this warm front moves in for the next few days.  The wind is audible here as well but it is expected to die down significantly as the day goes on.  It should be a beautiful day as we transition to warmer temperatures.</p>
<p>Grooming took care of our favorite runs last night and continue to impress everyone with their work.  The mountain looks really great, and you can see it for yourself from 7 different lifts today: SuperQuad, Skyline, Skidway, Snubber and DRC East at 8:30am followed by King Pine and Whiffletree at 9:00am.  Park news I’ve yet to mention – STP revamped Stomping Grounds last week installing a bunch of new rail features.  Still open as well for parks is Dropline, Sidewinder and Spurline. </p>
<p>Tonight we’ll see temperatures stay high with some light mix/snow, and tomorrow we’re in for some freezing drizzle and light showers.  More details to come in the afternoon report on that but first things first, go fast and have fun today.</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
