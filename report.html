<p>Into each life, some freezing rain must fall. Or something like that. Today's chance for snow showers turned out to be a chance for about an hour and a half of freezing rain, but it wasn't enough to dampen spirits or spoil a perfectly good day on the mountain. Precip has stopped as of 2pm this afternoon and snow surfaces are no worse for the wear, leaving us with a pleasant afternoon to wrap up the weekend. </p>
<p>Snowmakers shut things down earlier today as the weather moved in, and they will take a roughly 48 hour break while this week's arctic blast passes through. Temperatures are set to take a nosedive tonight, and we'll be down in the single digits by tomorrow morning, with summit temps dipping below zero. By Tuesday morning we should be well below zero, and we'll likely stay that way until Wednesday morning, when temps will climb back up into the teens. Snowmakers will fire things back up on Wednesday, with Timberline and Sidewinder in their sights. </p>
<p>A note on snowmaking: while it is possible for us to keep making snow through extreme cold snaps like we're expecting Monday and Tuesday (overnight lows are expected to be around 20 below zero up on the mountain), it does present a unique set of risks - both to the snowmaking infrastructure and to the snowmakers themselves. If anything unexpted occurs, snowmakers need to be able to react instantly to prevent frozen pipes and damage to equipment. With forecasts calling for favorable snowmaking conditions from Wednesday on, we've elected to give our snowmakers a well-deserved rest on Monday and Tuesday, and avoid the added risk to the system. </p>
<p>If you're headed our way tomorrow look for 45 open trails spanning 268 acres. Groomers will be out and about on much of that tonight with 37 trails slated for fresh corduroy tonight. High temps will be in the single digits, so pack your puffy coat and some extra hand warmers. Winds should be similar to today, so be sure to check in for any updates on lift status first thing tomorrow morning. We'll have seven lifts scheduled to turn for you tomorrow, winds and weather permitting. The King Pine lift will not run Monday-Wednesday this week, but terrain in the King Pine Bowl will be accessible from the Skyline lift. King Pine will be back open on Thursday. </p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
