<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Another incredible finish yesterday in nationals racing – this time in the Giant Slalom where we crowned another New Hampshire native champion, George Steffey, in his first ever national title.  It was an incredibly tight race with only three-tenths separating first and third place.  Joining Steffey on the podium was fellow US racer Brian McLaughlin in second, and Austrian Skier Tobias Kogler in third. </p>
<p>Today the Women’s Giant Slalom racers will take to the hill for the final event of the 2022 Toyota US Alpine National Championships here at Sugarloaf.  It should be another exciting race and a great finish to what has been a wild few weeks.  As snow reporter this morning I’d like to personally shout out a big thanks to everybody at Sugarloaf who worked night and day making this thing happen, to everyone involved with the US National Ski Team and to all the race teams from around the world that made this possible by being here to compete. </p>
<p>Back to weather, today will be closer to that warmth we were starting to get used to.  34-38 degrees at base and 32-36 degrees at top predicted for midday.  Winds are low at SuperQuad; a bit higher up by Skyline, but not enough to hold anything.  We should have a mixture of clouds and sun to ski under today.</p>
<p>Last night we received some precipitation on-hill that started as snow and worked its way to sleet and then rain as the temperature rose into this morning.  However, I’m being told the combination of temperature and snow made for surprisingly good grooming.  The hardness our snow got over the past few days will likely hold up today and make for some really fun conditions.  We have the usual stuff on the menu today in terms of groomed trails and lifts – everything under the lifts below Spillway Crosscut and this week’s 7 chairs: SuperQuad, Skyline, Snubber, Skidway, and DRC East at 8:30am, followed by King Pine and Whiffletree at 9:00am.</p>
<p>This evening we have a bit of a precipitation system moving in.  We’re going to see how it plays out, and it will likely come in a multitude of forms over the next couple days.  Tomorrow will likely throw us some rainfall but hopefully sandwiched in between some snow tonight and tomorrow night.  Finger’s crossed, more on this in future reports, for now go out and enjoy this warm beautiful day ahead of us.</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
