<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Welcome to March skiers and riders.  Today we kick off what is historically Sugarloaf’s snowiest month.  We also have lots of great events to look forward to in the coming weeks such as the 10<sup>th</sup> Annual WinterKids Downhill 24 (4<sup>th</sup>&amp;5<sup>th</sup>), Sugarloaf Banked Slalom / Inferno Cross Country Ski Cross (12<sup>th</sup>&amp;13<sup>th</sup>), and how could we not be stoked to hold the 2022 Toyota U.S. Alpine Championships at Sugarloaf (March 20<sup>th</sup> – April 1<sup>st</sup> ).</p>
<p>In weather - the cold air persisted through the night.  Despite what the thermostat says this morning we should get up to about 18-22 degrees at base midday with SW/SSE 14-20mph winds.  The top will reach 8-12 degrees and W/WSW 25-40 mph winds.  I’m keeping faith that it’s going to be warmish later.  As mentioned yesterday, we are lined up for a bit of snow this afternoon so expect mostly clouds until then.  As for the snow itself, it will likely start in the early afternoon and fall inconsistently throughout the evening accumulating 1-2 inches. </p>
<p>Last night our talented groomers spent some extra time flattening the bumps on Skidder, cutting some new lines on Upper Gondi and Gondi Extension as well as hitting most of their normal weeknight routine.  Today, lifts will include Superquad, Skyline, DRC East, Snubber and Skidway at 8:30am followed by Whiffletree, King Pine and Timberline at 9:00am.  Open terrain park includes a great range of difficulty level now with everything open; starting with beginner features in Boardwalk and Upper Tote, moderate features in Spurline, Stomping Grounds and Sidewinder (SnowCross course), and now we really got a big booter in Dropline as well some long handrails and super creative hits like the pyramid.</p>
<p>All in all it should be a solid day to be out there.  If even for just a few in the morning or a few in the afternoon, you’ll be glad you came.</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
