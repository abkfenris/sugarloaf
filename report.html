<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>I still just cannot believe how much snow we are still skiing and riding on heading into the last week of skiing operations here at Sugarloaf. For those who have experienced the King of Spring this weekend, I truly hope when it’s the middle of summer and when you’re sweating profusely that you can remember this weekend of snow riding around free with fresh cool moving air all around you.</p>
<p>The grooming team tonight will again hit the hill and hit a limited assortment of mid-mountain terrain for tomorrow’s continued spring vibathon. Please be aware with freezing temperatures overnight ungroomed snow surfaces can lock up quite hard and prove dangerous. Sometimes Ski Patrol will have to temporarily close terrain for the first few hours of the day until sun and warm temperatures are able to soften surfaces up. The Spring Operations Schedule continues with Skyline and SuperQuad spinning through the week into our last week of operations for the 21/22 ski season.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for temps dropping to below freezing around the base area firming up today’s saturated snowpack. Temps quickly rise on Monday when we will see highs peak in the low-to-mid 50s around the base giving us another incredible corn harvest for tomorrow. Winds remain calm Monday with speeds ranging from 15-25mph. The rest of the week brings another active cycle to the area where we are looking to see on and off precipitation events varying in heaviness.</p>
<p>Stay Tuned,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
