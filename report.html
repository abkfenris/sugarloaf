<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Today was a great day for fast runs and deep carves.  The sun ended up shining down on us nearly all day and the wind held off for the most part allowing for a reasonably pleasant outing.</p>
<p>Tonight we’re going to see temperatures continue to drop into the negatives, but conditions tomorrow should be similar if not warmer.  Grooming will be hitting their weekly hits, lifts will be consistent with the weekday schedule tomorrow and snowmaking is trying to find the right time to finally finish up Gondi Line Extension and White Nitro Extension before they call it a season.  We are also going to be seeing some finishing touches go onto Dropline Park over the next few nights into this week.</p>
<p>This cold stretch will be short lived, although, not in the way we might be happy about- rain is possible later this week as temperatures are going to shoot back up Wednesday and Thursday as another low pressure system moves into the valley. </p>
<p>Stay tuned as we will be keeping you posted about conditions and forecasting throughout the week.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
