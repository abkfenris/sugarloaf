<p>Old Man Winter has been a regular visitor this week, and today he kicked the party up a notch with 3-4 inches of fresh snow at higher elevations. Strong wind gusts were also on the menu, but our tireless lift operations team rose to the challenge, getting #3 T Bar up and running for skiers and riders out shredding the spring pow. The afternoon hours brought ever-so-slightly warmer temperatures and patches of sun, but it’s still feeling very much like mid-winter up here today.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we’ll see much of the same, with high temperatures again in the mid-twenties up top and high-thirties at the base. Strong wind gusts are once again forecast for tomorrow, so we may see changes to our late season <a href="/spring-operations-schedule">lift operation schedule</a> – like we did today – so be sure to check back in the morning for the latest updates.</p>
<p>The grooming team plans to smooth surfaces on Tote Road, Candyside, Kings Landing, Sluice, and Boardwalk for tomorrow – which should offer some of the best skiing and riding conditions thanks to the fresh snow.</p>
<p>Now that we're deep into the spring skiing season, you should expect surfaces to be pretty firm in the mornings, before they loosen up later in the day as temps rise. These freeze thaw cycles make for great corn snow, but they also mean that you may find some trails roped off in the mornings until snow softens enough for Ski Patrol to open them up. During this time of year, the open trail count you see on this report is a reflection of the trails we expect to open at some point during the day, once surfaces soften.</p>
<p>Happy Trails,<br/>Noelle</p>
