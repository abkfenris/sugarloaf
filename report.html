<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>With just 2 days left of the 2022 ski season it’s 100% time to call your best ski pal, grab all your favorite snow riding goodies, and head up to the Loaf to take it all in, enjoy some fresh mountain air, and count your blessings of another year of riding at Sugarloaf. Conditions this weekend will be diverse in the way that today you can pretend to be a ski racer on Narrow Gauge and rip the fast, cold corduroy, while Sunday will bring us a blissful day for the final lift serviced corn harvest.</p>
<p>The grooming team last night hit the trails and groomed a variety of terrain from Tote Road over to Sluice. Additions to the grooming list for this weekend are Comp Hill, Narrow Gauge, and Spillway. So get out there and enjoy some consistent fall line corduroy.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for a cloudy start with a chance of snow showers, temps ranging from 30-40 degrees depending what elevation you are at, with winds 20-30mph with gusts to 40 on the summit. As the day goes on clouds begin to gradually clear out leaving us with the possibility of a partly sunny afternoon. Tonight temps cool down to around freezing before Sunday gives way to ideal weather for the last huraaah, with mostly sunny skies and highs in the 50s.</p>
<p>Take it easy, and walk with a light step.</p>
<p>Chris</p>
