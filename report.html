<p style="text-align: justify;">Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happy Monday madness! There is a winter weather advisory in effect today, so please drive carefully when traveling to and from the mountain today; we are expecting heavy snowfall with accumulation totals landing anywhere from 8-15 inches, with precipitation occuring from around 4:00am this morning through 7:00pm tonight. It’s going to be a good start to the week, and a great day to grab some powder!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With a strong cup of the good stuff and a hard night’s work, the grooming department has radioed in and are on track with getting all of the trails that are scheduled groomed and ready for first tracks. The snow has already started to fall and the trails are looking good, which means a break for the snowmakers as natural snow falls for these next few days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s going to be a short report today. as the weather speaks for the mountain and we gear up for Mother Nature’s storm: current weather includes light snow with temps of 19 degrees and winds of 20 MPH by the base today with temps of 15 degrees and winds of 45 MPH at the summit. Heavy snow is coming in quick. with temperatures expected to peak around 28F-34F today. We hope to see your smiling faces crushing mounds of powder today and are excited to be out on the mountain with you!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have a great day,</p>
<p>David</p>
