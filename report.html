<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The Sunday fun day Is here for the taking. So make that first chair, ski that double black, or find a new place on the mountain to just relax and take it all in. With the corn cycle and nice weather continuing into tomorrow, a good choice could be to just book the extra night and enjoy another day of snow riding at the King of Spring.</p>
<p>The grooming team took to the hill and hit the usual late-season list around the central mountain. Make sure to check below for this morning’s grooming report. Please be advised when melting snow freezes overnight it leaves off-piste terrain hard and dangerous to ski, so sometimes Patrol will opt to close the terrain for a couple of hours until it corns up nicely from warm temps and sun. Our <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/spring-operations-schedule">Spring Lift Operations</a> continue on today with SuperQuad, Skyline, and Double Runner.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for mostly sunny skies with high temperatures reaching the low 50s around the base. Winds are calm today with speeds ranging from 15-20mph. This morning temperatures Top of Skyline were reported at 21 degrees so make sure to wear and extra layer this morning and anticipate some fast snow riding conditions.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
