<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Well, we got a little less snow and a little more wind than we were anticipating, but that is just alright and true Sugarloafers know that it’s the same as it ever was, and if you really want it you can go and get it. The forecast down the road is looking eventful and Sugarloaf is her best shape yet in 2022. The next few days are primed for greatness with diminishing winds, snow showers, and continued cold. With some warmer temperatures towards the end of this week right now is the best time to come take advantage of soft mid-season conditions.</p>
<p>The snowmakers have fired things up on Sluice Headwall and Dropline and plan on getting things set up and fired upon Wedge proper from Spillway Cross Cut. The grooming department will head out in force and buff out most of our on-piste terrains, and you know that fresh snow is going to create delicious corduroy for tomorrow’s early birds.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for diminishing winds and temperatures dropping down to around 0 degrees at the base. Tomorrow shows rising temps to around the mid-teens around the base and single digits at the summit. Clouds will increase throughout the morning leading to snow showers in the afternoon. Tuesday brings sun, calm winds, and warming temperatures to the mid-20. Come and get it while it’s prime!</p>
<p>Have a wonderful week,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
