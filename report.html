<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Today was another great day for kite enthusiasts as strong winds were the leading story, but the sun is starting to poke out here this afternoon, and forecasts are calling for gusts to diminish overnight. And thanks to a few inches of fresh snow yesterday conditions and coverage are looking sweet as we head into the second half of the week. </p>
<p>We'll see cooling temperatures overnight, which will likely stiffen up snow surfaces, but forecasts are calling for highs climbing into the fifties around the base by mid-day. So if you're hoping to harvest some corn, tomorrow afternoon will be your best opportunity. </p>
<p>Tonight the grooming team will again be hitting the hill and buffing out mid-mountain terrain including Tote Road, Kings Landing, Narrow Gauge, and Sluice. We have the same three lifts scheduled to spin tomorrow at 8:30am, SuperQuad, Skyline, and Double Runner East. And for those of you looking ahead, you can find our complete<a href="/spring-operations-schedule"> spring lift operation schedule here</a>. </p>
<p>That's all for now. Be sure to check back in the morning for the latest update.</p>
