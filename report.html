<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> This morning skiers and riders arrived to snow globe-like conditions, which really started to ring in the Holiday Vibes. About an inch of snow fell on the mountain first part of the day leaving our trails skiing great. Our grooming team finished off Narrow Gauge last night allowing patrol to further expand our snow sliding opportunities.  </p>
<p> The snowmakers were out enjoying the fruits of their labor today, by skiing and riding. In case you’re wanting to learn how to spot an off-duty snowmaker just look for the one that is shredding past you making you feel old. Tomorrow they will be back at it firing up snow guns on Spillway, Lower Winters Way, and the Landing. The grooming team will once again be hitting all 14 open trails tonight.</p>
<p> Today started off with snow but things have since changed over to a light wet sleet. Tonight light mixed precip will taper off late into the night. Things will start cooling off as the system departs early Friday morning. Definitely bring your chapstick tomorrow because the winds are going to be ripping 20-40 at the base with gusts up to the 80s at the summit – which will likely impact summit access, so be sure to check back here in the morning for all the details. </p>
<p>Temperatures will steadily drop throughout the day, eventually getting to the low teens by tomorrow night at the base. Our next storm system is looking to arrive Monday and Tuesday, and our pal Keith Carson has all the deets up on the <a href="/blog/carson-blog-post-dec-2">blog</a>. </p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that there will be no beginner terrain available from the top of either lift, and uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em></p>
<p>Catch you right here in the morning,</p>
<p>Chris </p>
