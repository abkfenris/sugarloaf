<p>Good afternoon, Sugarloaf skiers and riders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After some fresh flurries this morning, the sun made its way through the cloudy skies, allowing a gorgeous afternoon to unfold. Temperatures are reading 29 by the base with 13 degrees at the summit with calm winds all around, and let me tell you, there’s nothing like having fresh snow underfoot and warm sunshine overhead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Open terrain today includes 82 trails or 436 acres of mountain to charge. Snow Reporter’s pick for today would have to be that Hollywood-style Spillway run under the Skyline lift; it was just dreamy. Freestyle skiers and riders are putting down tricks in Boardwalk (small), Spurline (medium), Stomping Grounds (medium/large), and Upper Tote (small/medium) while anticipation for Drop Line and Sidewinder continues to build. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tonight, our incredible grooming team will be hitting Lower Gondi Line and flattening those whales on Competition Hill in addition to grooming out some of the other routine weekday trails, including Skidway and Timberline. Snowmakers are halting operations for a few days, in an exciting turn of events, while they wait to see what this incoming storm could look like leading into the weekend. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We expect to see a significant temperature drop overnight, plummeting back to single digits and accompanied by some light snowfall (&lt;1”), and tomorrow will follow suit with temperatures around 3 degrees by the base with -3 at summit and winds around 20mph and 32mph, respectively. We also anticipate also see the sunny skies again tomorrow. Looking further ahead, don’t forget to keep your eyes on that radar for this weekend!</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
