<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Temperatures have moderated and temps are sitting right around zero this morning. We wave goodbye to the arctic air for now, but it’s looking to make a return before long. So you’ve got a few days to enjoy some snow sliding in somewhat normal temperatures. So grab your puffy, chapstick, favorite treats, and your best ski pal and come enjoy the Western Maine Mountains.</p>
<p>Today we have 6 lifts scheduled to service 44 trails, of which 34 were groomed overnight. The snowmakers are arriving at the mountain to ideal conditions and will immediately get things going on Timberline and Sidewinder. The park crew has worked tirelessly since the weekend pushing, grooming, deliberating, hand shoveling, and setting rails to bring you the fruits of their efforts today by opening the Stomping Grounds Park.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for clouds and some sun with temperatures in the mid-teens at the base and single digits at the summit. Winds from the southwest will be in the 20-40mph range. Tonight the weather remains consistent with what we’ll see today before starting a warming trend into Thursday. Looking further ahead, Friday brings some light snow before arctic air bum rushes us again Friday night where we will see temperatures returning to the below zero range for the weekend.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
