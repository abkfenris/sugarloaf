<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>We have made it through another cold and snowy week, and the snow surface couldn’t be any happier. This morning I noticed the faint glow of a distant sunrise, on what all year has been a dark starry commute. This allowed me to conclude that we truly are now entering into the glory days of winter here at Sugarloaf.</p>
<p>Last night the grooming team hit the hill and groomed a wide variety of terrain from Scoot to Widowmaker. The Lift Maintenance crew is still working to get King Pine back in the rotation and it will not be available for public operation today. The Lift crew also just came in with a report of -10 degrees at TOS with winds 20-25mph.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for sunny skies, moderate to heavy winds in the 30-55mph range. Temperatures will reach a high of around 19 degrees at the base today, while temps at the summit will remain in the single digits. Tonight temps fall again into the single digits around the base as winds consolidate to the 20-40 mph range. Saturday looks to be another sunny day with increasing clouds in the afternoon, and moderate winds as the temps increase to a high of 27 at the base.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
