<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6:30PM UPDATE: the storm has about wrapped up, leaving us with clear skies and dropping temperatures. All said and done, we've picked up a foot of fresh, allowing ski patrol to drop ropes on 13 trails with even more terrain expected to open tomorrow. Forecasts are calling for strong wind gusts that could impact lift operations, so as always be sure to check back here in the morning for the latest info. </strong><span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What a day; we have been waiting all season for a whopper of a storm like this, and Old Man Winter finally delivered. We've picked up 8" so far and it is still coming down hard. Ropes have been dropping all over the mountain and with a few more hours of steady snowfall you can expect to see even more open terrain throughout the day tomorrow. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you rest your tired legs, we've got a lot of work ahead this afternoon to get the mountain primed for your enjoyment tomorrow including, digging out and clearing all the roads and parking areas. The snowmakers get a night off from snowmaking, but they are hardworking team members and come in to lend a hand for all the cleanup needed on big storms like this.  The groomers will be back at it again like always overnight putting in work on the mountain grooming out this fresh powder – but don't worry, they'll leave some natural stuff for you to enjoy too.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Weather looks like it's holding for now with heavy snow all over from the top-to-bottom. Temperatures have climbed nearing their peak for the day at 23F near the summit and 34F near the base. Visibility is limited so ski carefully, and remember to keep your eyes open and head on a swivel for the Yeti who roams the mountain. Things look like they will be clearing up tonight sometime this evening, with snowfall reducing to light flurries tonight and then finally giving way for the night. Tomorrow looks like a doozy, with cold temperatures in the single-to-negative digits as well as some post-storm wind. Stay tuned and check back in with us in the AM for trail and lift updates and, as always, have a wonderful night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cheers!<br/>David</p>
