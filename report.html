<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Boy, the snow is just coming down out there. pasting everything with wintery goodness! The best skiing of the day is still yet to be had. If you're close, you still got time to get up here enjoy some lasties. There's nothing quite like getting up to the mountain late with a pocket beer to catch the last runs of the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tonight, the groomers will be heading out and adding today's snow to the tasty surface our last storm left us with, which should rise to the "scrumptious" category. The snowmakers tried to hold on today, but the winds and temperatures just wouldnâ€™t cooperate; things are down for now, but our snowmakers are on stand-by to get things fired up as soon as the proper conditions come around. The park crew has been busy getting our newest park set up on Boardwalk, featuring jumps, rails, and boxes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather tonight shows snow will be wrapping up this evening with a quick temperature drop behind the departure of our current system; winds will also ramp up significantly, elevating to 30 mph by the base and 40-75 mph at the summit; <strong>please anticipate the possibility that this may impact lift operations.</strong> Wind and cold will persist into tomorrow under sunny skies.</p>
<p>Safe travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
