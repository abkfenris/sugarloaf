<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> This morning things kicked off with premier piste skiing with warm and pleasant temperatures. The winds picked up and placed a few things on wind hold but soft skiing from the SuperQuad kept the smiles rolling. A brief and heavy precipitation event just rolled through sending some in for an early lunch while the true Sugarloafers braved the moisture and routed it back up the Quad for more soft spring-like turns.</p>
<p>The grooming team will operate in a very limited capacity tonight due to incoming weather. They’ll get to a handful of blue square trails and most likely leave the rest alone. To preserve the snow so we can continue enjoying Sugarloaf well into spring it’s just best to leave the snow alone when it becomes saturated from rain.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for a bit of a sloppy night. Mixed precipitation continues tonight into tomorrow morning. Temps will remain above freezing over much of the mountain. Which should keep things nice and soft for tomorrow’s snow riding. Tomorrow brings another day of temps in the 28-36 degree range while winds calm down a bit to the 25-45mph range with gusts to 55 on the summit. I think we have a good chance for most lifts to run tomorrow. Things look to cool off again Monday night where we are looking at a chance of 1-3 inches of snow. Keep your fingers crossed and have an awesome and productive start to your workweek.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
