<p>**PEAK ALERT: Icing is possible this afternoon due to the temperature inversion today.  Please use caution on your commute home. **</p>
<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>What a day out there today.  The buzz of February break on the mountain always brings back intoxicating memories of my youth, and magical stretches of never-ending good times.</p>
<p>I saw a lot of folks out there today enjoying said times, despite some unideal visibility and wind conditions.  A fog over the mountain made it pretty hard to see, and gusts kept Timberline down for most of the day.  Besides that, lifts were able to run in full capacity and there was much skiing to be had.  Snow conditions are surely variable right now but thankfully the warm temperatures are helping keep everything reasonably soft.</p>
<p>As the alert states, there is significant chance of icing with temps hovering around freezing today, but also due to precipitation that will pick up around 6:00pm.  We are looking at snow/mix to rain, with a predicted &lt;1”/&lt;.10” ice and .50-.65” rain.  High winds will also continue into tonight and actually pick up even more tomorrow.  It has already been determined by our operations teams that Timberline will most likely not run tomorrow.</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be windier (S/W 20-35mph base, W/WSW 50-70 mph top), and it will also be significantly warmer with temps as high as 44-48 at base and 33-37 at top, with possibly more rain showers early on.  Although it’s hard to look at this rain as anything but catastrophic, I’m hoping to make the best of it by taking advantage of some soft laps in the parks and having fun getting a little wet!</p>
<p>Looking further into the week, we can count on cold making a comeback as we cool down Wednesday night into Thursday.  The next system arrives Thursday night/Friday morning with an overall colder setup, moderate-significant snow is possible and it’s likely to remain cold into the last few days of the month.  We’re even watching for another storm for Sunday/Monday so stay tuned with your veteran Snow Reporter Chris for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
