<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>It’s hard to believe that we’re halfway through March but the late season stuff is starting to happen.   Daylight savings hitting yesterday felt like the sun didn’t set until about 8:00pm, Season Passes for next year just went up for sale (“Buy Now – Ski this Spring Too” starts next week), and we have some of our biggest events of the season in the pipeline.  U.S. National Alpine Championships starting next week, and Reggae Fest just around the corner.</p>
<p>In weather; this morning feels similar to yesterday with a soft warmth in the air.  31 degrees at the base and 24 at the top this morning with temperatures to hold throughout the day.  Winds will be more or less similar to yesterday as well.  Most of the lower and eastern face of the mountain were quite calm but those prevailing western winds were enough to call for Timberline closure.  Light snow was falling early this morning in parts of the valley but chance for precipitation during the day is low with mostly cloudy sky cover predicted.</p>
<p>Snow is back on the menu with almost a foot in the last week we are back up to 91 trails and there’s so much to explore.  To take you there today we have 7 lifts scheduled to run including Snubber, Skidway, Superquad and Skyline at 8:30am with King Pine, Whiffle Tree and Timberline following at 9:00am.  If Timberline goes on wind hold then Double Runner East will run in its stead.  Additionally, our 5 parks: Boardwalk, Sidewinder, Spurline, Stomping Grounds and Dropline, in order of increasing difficulty, are very fun and this weather is so nice for park laps. </p>
<p>Last night was pretty warm with temps staying in the 20’s giving our groomers a good chance to do what they do best as they hit their weeknight routine.  I’m once again putting my money on Flume, Widowmaker and Ramdown as some of the most fun trails to go get early this morning as they got fresh stripes again last night.  I’m out of things to say besides let’s go get after it ‘Loafers!</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
