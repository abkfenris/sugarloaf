<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> The racers of the Colby Carnival today battled foggy conditions as they raced Giant Slalom over the infamous Narrow Gauge Headwall. With tomorrow’s weather looking extremely unpleasant for competition, they are likely to postpone the event until Sunday. Which looks to be an ideal day for testing the limits of speed under full sun and on a fast and cold snowpack.</p>
<p>Snowmakers today maintained operations on Timberline and fired up equipment on Sidewinder. They also attempted to get guns going on Competition Hill. However, the wind was blowing the artificial snow across Comp Hill and into Narrow Gauge, at which point the snowmakers received a Cease and Desist order from the race committee. They will continue production tonight on Lower Comp, Chickens Pitch, and around Bullwinkles tonight. The grooming team is heading out this evening to tackle a majority of our open terrain, leaving us scheduled with 50 trails, 8 lifts, and 303 acres of terrain for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Tonight it’s as though an artic bomb is due to go off over Sugarloaf and we will be plunged into bitter cold with blustery winds. Temps are forecasted with lows down to -10 at the base and up to 21 below at the summit. Winds are forecasted in the 40-80mph range from the NW. Tomorrow expects highs around 0 with winds in the 40-75mph range with clearing skies. Sunday is looking bluebird with temps in the single digits and winds diminishing to the 25-40mph range. With tomorrow’s abysmal forecast is it highly <strong>likely we’ll see wind holds on lifts to the upper mountain.</strong> So make sure to check in with us here at the Mountain Report or @sugarloafsnow on Twitter nice and early to get the full scoop.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
