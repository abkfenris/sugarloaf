<p>Happy Maine Day,</p>
<p> After a brief respite of temperatures in the double digits, cold air begins to move back in over the area for the next few days. This has me considering the brave arctic explorers of the late 18<sup>th</sup> century. Who willingly set off into uncharted waters with a few years’ worth of canned food. Aware that many of their predecessors never returned, and knowing you’re ship will likely be locked into sea ice where you then must endure bitter cold and darkness. All the while hoping your ship will be set free when you then can hope to make a glorious discovery.</p>
<p>And here we are today in 2022 skiing beautiful Sugarloaf with 6 lifts servicing 82 trails, over 436 acres of available terrain. Snowmaking will remain offline through the weekend in anticipation of a possible large-scale storm coming on Friday. The grooming team tackled the projects of Upper Comp Hill and Upper Timberline last night preparing those runs with beautiful corduroy for today. Make sure to check below to see if your favorite trails were groomed last night.</p>
<p>Upcoming weather is again brimming with excitement in anticipation of a big snow storm for this weekend. Today expect a few clouds and sun with temperatures falling to the single-digits at the base and to below zero at the summit. Winds are expected to pick up slightly with speeds ranging from 20-40mph from the NW. Make sure to bring your puffy jacket and to look out for one another out there today.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
