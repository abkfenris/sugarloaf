<p style="text-align: justify;">Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today skiers and riders braved a cold forecast and gave Old Man Winter a hug; in turn, they were rewarded with full sun, smooth, and fast conditions with pockets of soft snow deposited by strong winds and flurries. I tended to come across these pockets on extreme skiers left. Today is just the acclimatization period though, as the real cold settles in tomorrow. Will you embrace winter and face the elements tomorrow?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The snowmakers will continue to enjoy an extended break from operations due to extreme cold. Even though we are all anxious to ski and ride new terrain, it’s in the best interest of all parties involved to simply abstain from pasting terrain for a couple of days. The grooming department, however, will tackle a large portion of our open terrain in the comfort of the heated cabs of snow cats and butter out all mid-mountain terrain. The Terrain Parks Crew continues to sculpt and perfect the Stomping Ground Park; there was talk of it opening today or tomorrow but, anything that’s worth doing is worth doing right the first time, and now they predict the jibbers to be jibbin’ on Wednesday.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tonight is going to be one of those nights that’s best spent snuggled with hot chocolate, a blanket, and your favorite beings watching <em>Gilligan’s Island</em>. Temps are forecadrop to -10 around the base of the mountain, where the summit will see temperatures as low as -24; winds will diminish slightly to the 35-40 MPH range. Things will warm up to a balmy -2 degrees around the base tomorrow, with temps on the upper mountain remaining around -13 degrees. Skies should remain partly cloudy with pockets of sun and winds persist in the 20-40 MPH range. Wednesday, look for a return to “normal” temperatures that skyrocket to above zero.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Safe travels,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris</p>
