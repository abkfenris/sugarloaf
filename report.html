<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Despite a few lingering showers this morning, the sky has dried and the clouds are beginning to burn off – just in time for après. Well played, Mother Nature. With temperatures in the forties, snow surfaces have remained soft and slashable, with even a few opportunities to practice your pond skimming form for this weekend. </p>
<p>Looking ahead to tomorrow, we’ll see more of the same weather and conditions as today, with increasing clouds, scattered showers and temperatures climbing towards 50 throughout the day. The end of the week like a bit unsettled, but as always we’ll be keeping a close eye on the forecasts, and updating you with the latest right here in the Mountain Report. </p>
<p>Due to the soft snow surfaces, our grooming team will have their work cut out for them this evening. These kinds of conditions make for slow going and challenging climbs. The goal is to get at least one or two trails striped off each of our scheduled lifts, which from tomorrow includes DRC-B, SuperQuad, Skyline and Kind Pine.  <a href="/spring-operations-schedule">Click here</a> for the complete schedule of our scaled-back spring lift operations.</p>
<p>Cheer, <br/>Noelle</p>
