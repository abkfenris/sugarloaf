<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> ‘Twas the day before Christmas and all through the hills, everyone was shredding, with marvelous skills. The powder boards sat near the window with care, in hopes that pow days galore would soon be there. The rippers were nestled all snug in their beds. While visions of face shots danced in their heads. And Amos with his antlers, and Berry with his bread. Had just settled in for the long winter’s shred.</p>
<p>Last night our Mountain Ops team took full advantage of a cold and clear night and started operations pumping 4000 gallons of water per minute on Widowmaker, Flume, Choker, Tohaul, and Cruiser. The grooming team was out enjoying the stars putting the finishing touches on Whiffletree, Lombard, and Slasher, which will be available for today’s skiing and riding. Also, make sure to check out the new terrain park on Boardwalk.</p>
<p>Today expect decreasing clouds and eventual sun, with temps in the low-to-mid teens. Winds diminished more than previously forecasted to the 25-45mph range. Today we have 8 lifts scheduled servicing 31 trails over 187 acres of terrain.  With cold temperatures and snow in the last 7 days, Things are looking prime, so come for a stay.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
