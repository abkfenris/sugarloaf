<p>Good afternoon, Sugarloafers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Temperatures have continued to drop today. We expect to see temperatures in the 20s to low 30s tomorrow, staying dry through Thursday, when we'll see the arrival of our next front. Snowmaking will be taking advantage of these favorable conditions to blow snow, getting the guns going on Sluice for resurfacing, Boardwalk, and Lower Scoot as well as parts of Whiffletree. Their plan going forward is to continue as long as temperatures allow. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tonight, our tireless team of groomers will head to the hill to get to work on 14 trails; they'll also begin tilling Windrow, which means we should see ropes dropping there by the weekend. We'll have the same 24 trails open tomorrow, accessible by our 5 scheduled lifts—that’s DRC B, Sawduster, Skidway, Skyline, and the SuperQuad, all scheduled to open at 8:30am.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Wondering what’s in store for the weekend? The forecast suggests we’re due for two cold fronts, the first of which arriving Friday and the second Saturday, with much colder air expected starting next Sunday. These should be some of the coldest temperatures we’ve seen yet, </span><span>which is good news for our snowmakers—after all, at this point in the season, expanding terrain is the name of the game</span><span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Also on Saturday is our annual <a href="/events-calendar/tree-lighting-festival" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tree Lighting Festival</a>—and Santa Claus will be coming to town, accompanied by Amos and friends! Come celebrate the season in Sugarloaf style with warm treats, music on the Beach, fireworks, and more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Enjoy your afternoons,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Gabrielle</span></p>
