<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> It is just really nice that old man winter finally showed up to the party, and by the looks of it appears he is here to stay for a while. Sugarloafers were at in force today smiling big and taking advantage of our first major snowfall of the season. The experience of hearing the hoots and hollers and yips first thing today quickly climbed right to the top of my list of highlights from so far this season.</p>
<p>Tonight the grooming crew will head out on the hill to go pop and smooth out all those powder bumps that were formed today. Groomer skiing first thing tomorrow is going to be lit with this new addition to our snowpack. The snowmakers are going to continue operations on Whiffletree, Ramdown, and Skidder. With temps taking a dive to the single digits tonight, and low teens throughout the week I’d be willing to bet we’ll be seeing some of these trails open up for us next weekend.</p>
<p>Tonight weather starts to clear. Temperatures plummet and the winds remain consistent in the 15-30mph range. Tomorrow expect sunny skies with fair temperatures in the low 20s and winds in the 15-30 mph range. Tomorrow is for sure going to be a real dandy, with sunny skies and fresh snow coating our beloved Carrabassett Valley.</p>
<p>Safe travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
