<p><strong>Update: SuperQuad remains on wind hold; Timberline is closed for the day. -8:52am</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s one of those Sugarloaf days that we couldn't go too far into the season without seeing. I was blown down a few steps walking the stairs to the building this morning, though such is life sometimes: two steps forward, one step back. However, all we need to do is persist and keep putting one foot in front of the other. If you’re planning on heading up to Sugarloaf today for some skiing or riding, <strong>please be prepared for</strong> <strong>the possibility of wind holds</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In operational news, our snowmaking night crew enjoyed an evening off from battling the darkness; the day crew, however, is coming in today to get snow guns running on Spillway, Lower Winter’s Way, and the Landing. The grooming team was out hitting our open terrain below the top of SuperQuad: Tote Road, Kings Landing, Narrow Gauge, Candy Side, and Lower Timberline all got some loving affection from the kitties. Now who doesn’t want that on a breezy day?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather today calls for temps in the mid-to-high 20s by the base and high teens at the summit. Clouds will be decreasing throughout the day, possibly letting a few pockets of sun through, meanwhile the strong winds of the Northwest will bludgeon the mountain today with speeds between 20 to 40 MPH at the base and gusts up to 80 MPH on the summit. Make sure to check back here at the mountain report or <a href="twitter.com/sugarloafsnow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@SugarloafSnow</a> on Twitter for the most recent lift and trail updates.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that there will be no beginner terrain available from the top of either lift, and uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em></p>
<p>Catch you right here in the afternoon,</p>
<p>Chris </p>
