<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Update</strong>: As of 1:30pm, King Pine remains on wind hold.</p>
<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today turned into some really good skiing! Luckily the winds (mostly) held back, and we were able to get you up the SuperQuad and over to Skyline. There has been talks about the T-Bar getting back into action soon, so let’s hope the snow is deep enough as ski patrol cruises on by for their checks; stay tuned and come back for an update on that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few mounds and moguls left here and there, if that’s what you are looking for. Other than that, grooming is going to put in another hard night's work prepping trails and getting things cleaned up nicely. Snowmakers are taking another break tonight while we settle the storms snow in its place, and rightfully so, with temperatures getting into the negative double digits and wind chills dropping degrees to -40 at the summit! The reoccurring theme for today is trying to stay warm, and that hasn’t changed one bit! Hopefully you all stayed toasty for your Tuesday turns and rest well so you can hit first chair, first thing tomorrow morning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We expect to see the winds die down this evening, which is always great to hear for lifts, while temperatures should hold steady through the night around zero by the base, picking up into the mid-to-high teens for tomorrow. So... low winds and warmer temperatures for Wednesday. As for today, I hope everyone had a great day hitting the hill. We are happy to be able to provide you with all the relative information we can as the day goes by and look forward to you enjoying your time here in the Valley.</p>
<p>Have a great night,</p>
<p>David  </p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
