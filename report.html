<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>A beautiful sunny day and frigid temperatures made for an adventurous day of skiing and riding. With wind chills reaching around -40 at TOS, I honestly commemorate the brave souls out there enjoying a sunny afternoon in the Western Maine Mountains.</p>
<p>Tonight our grooming team is scheduled to hit all major top to bottom trails with maybe an exception in the King Pine Bowl. The park crew will be finalizing the Stomping Grounds Park. Snowmakers are scheduled to come back in for Wednesday morning and get things fired up on Timberline, Sidewinder, and Chickens Pitch.  </p>
<p>After another frigid night tonight. The weather tomorrow returns to a reasonable state with temps in the single digits at the summit and highs reaching 18 degrees at the base. Winds are moderate from the southwest in the 20-40mph range. Skies are forecasted to be cloudy. Tomorrow night weather stays consistent before things warm up towards the freezing mark on Thursday ahead of some light snow showers. Stay warm out there and enjoy the warmth of your bed.</p>
<p>Have a cozy night,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
