<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yesterday was a great day to be out on the mountain, and today is shaping up to be even more of the same. Skies will be cloudier out there today but we're looking at comfortable temps in the mid-20s to low 30s, so you can leave the puffy jacket at home this morning. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have ten lifts scheduled to spin for you today, including King Pine, which we added to mix yesterday, giving skiers and riders more space to spread out across the mountain. Winds aren't looking like much of an issue out there today and shouldn't impact lift operations, but as always be sure to check back throughout the day for any updates. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Snowmakers were out and about last night on Stomping Grounds, Haywire, and Lower Scoot and will keep things going for as long as temps allow. Goomers had a full list last night as well, which included Choker, which should open up later this morning for the first time this season. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking down the road a bit, we have some more unsettled weather headed our way beginning late Saturday and into Sunday, with a mixed bag of rain, snow, and everything in between. Details are still coming together, so we'll keep an eye on it and provide any updates for you right here. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And good news for those of you sticking around for après-ski with Treadstone in The Widowmaker, or joining us for the Climb for Cure this evening, we have a handful of rooms at the Sugarloaf Mountain Hotel that are eligible for <a href="/booklodging">one-night-stay bookings</a>. So put on your dancing (or climbing) shoes, and join us for the second to last night of 2021 right here at Sugarloaf.  </p>
<p>See you on hill,<br/>Ethan</p>
