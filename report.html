<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Well, today’s event certainly came out of right field. Strong winds and an array of different precipitations bludgeoned the mountain today. There is still hope for us to get back on the hill with the SuperQuad for this afternoon, but as always it’s up to our boss, Mother Nature. Our crews are standing by monitoring winds speeds and will get lifts turning as soon as it is safe.</p>
<p>The grooming squad will hit the hill in a limited fashion tonight due to moist precipitation and warm temperatures. Expect to see a trail or two to be groomed from the top of each lift. This volatile weather always leaves our grooming team balancing different variables while maintaining a high standard which is often a challenge. </p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for a continued smorgasbord of precipitation. Temps remain around freezing while winds calm down. Friday looks to be another day of mixed rain/snow/sleet, with temps in the 30s and winds starting to switch directions to the NW. With prevailing winds settling over the region I am hopeful we’ll have most of our lifts running tomorrow. The weekend brings cloudy days with chances of snow and cooler temperatures.   </p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
