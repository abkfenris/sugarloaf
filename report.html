<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>It is great seeing people with sunburn walking around and getting on lifts. Things definitely feel like they have turned the corner to spring for better or for worse. All I know is if you’ve been here snow riding the last few days enjoying yourself. You have definitely been making a series of good decisions to be here.</p>
<p>Again the groomers will hold off for most of the night waiting till temperatures cool off enough for the snowpack to freeze up. We’ll likely see a similar plan of action for tonight where we’ll have about 1 maybe 2 trails groomed from the top of each lift. Tomorrow the lift department has all of our lifts scheduled to run to whisk you up to all points of Sugarloaf.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for increasing clouds and the onset of a storm that is threatening us to maybe have to call the snowmakers out of retirement. As of now, I would guess that won’t be the case with this storm.  It is appearing that the majority of the precipitation in this event will fall as snow, sleet, or freezing rain. Temperatures remain right around freezing for Saturday with winds in from the SE at 30-45mph, which should allow for most lifts to operate tomorrow. Saturday night is when things get wet and it is likely that everything will switch over to the dreaded R-word into Sunday. Sunday night things will cool down halting the demise of our snow, and creating a wonderful surface for all of the Nation’s best ski racers as they come into town and prepare for the US Alpine Championships starting on Monday.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
