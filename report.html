<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>What a Sunday fun day we have out there today. Smooth slopes, no lines, and calm winds are really making for a high quality day of snow riding. With the corn cycle kicking in early this week there is no better time to take a mental health day and enjoy some prime spring skiing at the Loaf.</p>
<p>The grooming team will again hit the hill tonight with favorable conditions to paste out a bunch of corduroy across the mountain for Mondays snow riding enjoyment. Most off-piste terrain remains closed due to hard and icy conditions. However, with a corn cycle on the way for the first part of the week we could always hope to see some of our favorite natural snow trails return to the roster.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for temps cooling off to lows around 25 degrees at the base while we see some light snow falling which has the possibility of producing up to an inch of snow. Tomorrow we’ll see decreasing clouds and increasing winds, nothing major though with speeds reaching up to 40mph NW at the summit. Temperatures will reach highs in the upper 30’s on Monday before falling below freezing Monday night. Tuesday is looking to be a banner day with bluebird skies and highs in the mid 40’s. Wednesday looking to be another sunny warm day before clouds move in for the second half of the week when we will start to be affected by a long term weather event from Thursday into the weekend.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
