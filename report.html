<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>It was pretty easy to get in the groove and let the good times roll today. Inversions, full lift operations, blue sky, and singing birds really are making today awesome. If you get a chance to come up this afternoon grab your hot dog skis and a credit card because the skiing is prime and the sunny Bullwinkle porch is calling.</p>
<p>Tonight the grooming team will hit the hill and once again cover the mountain in a canvas of corduroy. The competition crew is starting to move in full swing to prepare Narrow Gauge for the upcoming US Alpine Championships starting next week. It is quite a task to prepare a ski slope for the highest level ski athletes in the nation and our crews every year are up to the challenge.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for temps to drop to a low of around 30 degrees at the base. Winds remain calm through Thursday where we are looking to have another banner bluebird day for snow riding. Temps tomorrow will reach a high of around 48 degrees at the base while the summit sits comfortably at around 35 degrees with winds 20-35mph. These forecasted speeds should allow for full lift operations tomorrow. Warm weather and calm winds persist into the weekend with clouds moving in Friday ahead of a disturbance looking to affect us Saturday to Monday. Currently, the storm looks a little messy but confidence is low in any outcome so we’ll just have to sit back and enjoy the next few days.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
