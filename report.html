<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> Pull out your flip-flops, shorts, and your favorite umbrella cocktail because it is feeling balmy this morning. With a big storm brewing, the return of King Pine lift, and pleasurable weather afoot, today is slated for greatness. Fueled by the anticipation and excitement of the prospect of some powder skiing. Expect 7 lifts servicing 283 acres of terrain on 48 trails.</p>
<p>The snowmaking team continued operations on Sidewinder and Timberline, while also getting additional equipment running on Slasher and The Landing. Snowmaking will continue through today so don’t go humchuckin’ yourself into Slasher. The grooming department hit pretty much everything last night except for Choker.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for temperatures in the upper 20s at the base and low 20s at the summit. Winds are chillin’ in the 20-30mph range, expect cloudy skies and isolated snow showers. Friday appears as a similar day to today but with isolated snow showers. Then Friday night it’s as if the white walkers from Game of Thrones set up camp in Sugarloaf Village.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
