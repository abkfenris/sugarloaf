<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happy Monday to you all, and be sure to watch your step as you venture outside to find another breezy but warm day ahead of you. We’re really on our way into the heat of the springtime here and it feels incredible!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today should be interesting as the forecasts suggests temperatures will slowly drop throughout the day; pockets of sunshine are showing here at dawn, but we expect to be taking turns today under mostly cloudy skies with a chance mix of snow and rain showers picking up around noon. At the base, we’re seeing 32-36 degrees with WNW/NNE 14-20 mph winds and at the top it reads 28-32 (may fall) with WNW/SW 35-55 winds. As a result, lift ops has decided to call Timberline a no-go today; King Pine will also be offline as it is experiencing a similar mechanical issue to last week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite closures to start the morning, 6 chairs are scheduled today to lift you up above over 100 trails of Sugarloaf terrain: Double Runner East, Skidway, Skyline, Snubber, and the SuperQuad are schedule to start spinning at 8:30am followed by Whiffletree at 9:00am. As Snow Reporter Chris mentioned in yesterday’s report, grooming work was minimal last night as we experienced some precipitated wetness; thankfully the temperature on the old Loaf herself was cold enough to resist any significant snow losses last night. Besides a few patches at the base, we totally survived. <strong>However, due to this sudden change in temperatures, please be prepared that we will only be opening groomed terrain today.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, please note that <strong>Bullwinkle's Bistro will be closed today</strong> (Monday, March 7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be sure to give a nod to your fellow skiers and riders out there today, as they are likely true Loafers. And don’t get me wrong: I am truly excited to be skiing on a day like today! Some nice soft turns, landings and spills is what I wait for all year… wind will not stop me from acquiring stoke, nor should it stop you!</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
