<p>Well folks, today's the day. It's the final day of the 2021/22 ski season here at Sugarloaf, and it's shaping up to be a doozy. Forecasts are calling for ample sunshine with temps topping out in the mid to upper 50s here at the base. Throw in 50-plus open trails with near wall-to-wall coverage, and you've got yourself a pretty spectacular closing day. </p>
<p>Temps did drop below freezing last night and are just now creeping above 32 here at the base, so expect things to start out on the crunchy side this morning. Once the suns climbs a little higher though, it will be full-on corn harvest time. The grooming team was out and about last night, so you'll find a bunch of your favorites with fresh corduroy this morning, including Kings Landing, Sluice, and Spillway. </p>
<p>We'll have the SuperQuad and Skyline turning for the final day, and it doesn't look like winds will be an issue for us at all out there. </p>
<p>So head on up, pack the sunscreen, and come splash through some bumps.  It's been a great season, and we're sending it out with a bang. </p>
<p>Ethan</p>
