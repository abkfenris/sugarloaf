<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Mother Nature put on an incredible show this morning which was the true opening act of <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/events-calendar/reggae-fest">34<sup>th </sup>Annual Reggae Fest</a>. Just like Reggae Fest, the show this morning was a multi-stage extravaganza where each location brought a unique vibe. So<em> get up, stand up</em> rude boy it’s time to <em>Exodus </em>to the Jah’Loaf.</p>
<p>Due to warm temperatures persisting well into last night the grooming team got a late start to accomplish a limited list of targets for this morning. Snow was frozen at the base first thing this morning. However, with temperatures rising throughout the day surfaces should soften up for another corn harvest today that will start a little bit later today compared to yesterday.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for increasing clouds this morning, with a wintery mix beginning this afternoon and continuing into tonight. High temps will be in the mid-40s around the base, while the air remains around freezing at the summit. Winds are elevated today coming from the SE with speeds 15-25mph with gusts to 45mph on the summit.</p>
<p>Travel Safely,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
