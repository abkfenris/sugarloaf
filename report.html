<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Rise and shine skiers and riders, it is time to prepare yourselves for greatness and seize the day. Don’t be spooked by the arctic air you will experience first thing this morning because the temps are going to moderate and rise to reasonable levels today. With calm winds and shining sun, it’s a perfect day to get a full dose of vitamin d, and revitalize yourself with a day for YOU in the mountains.</p>
<p>Snowmakers are enjoying perfect conditions for efficient snowmaking. Last night they turned guns to full bore on Gondola Line and our large/advanced terrain park in Drop Line. Currently this morning they are working to get Upper Timberline and Gondi Extension running. Starting equipment in these temperatures can often be tedious and time-consuming. It’s mostly because everything is frozen and requires the encouragement of a high-flow propane torch. The groomers hit the mountain in force last night and groomed out all of our snowmaking terrain except for Choker. You’ll find corduroy from West Mountain to Haulback.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for a real dandy with temps rising to the single digits and low teens, calm winds 5-15mph, and a full-on sunny day. Looking ahead. Tonight temperatures will consolidate in the single digits, before again rising to the upper teens and lower 20s for Sunday, where we have the potential for a few snow showers. Cold persists into the week with occasional flurries.</p>
<p>With a beautiful day ahead slated for greatness, it would be a shame to be schlepped down the hill by one of our fine Ski Patrollers or to have your pass confiscated. The best thing to prevent these scenarios is to make sure you’re following the skier’s code of conduct and to obey all signs and closures. Above all else, look out for one another, give a helping hand, and have some fun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Be Kind,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
