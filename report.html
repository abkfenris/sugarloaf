<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The greatness that Sugarloaf has experienced in the last couple of weeks cannot be overstated. The last two weeks have brought us over 2.5 feet of snow along with cold temperatures to preserve it. The on-piste skiing remains dreamy and soft, while the off-trail has filled in nicely providing perfect conditions for bump skiing.</p>
<p>Tonight the groomers set out to buff out all of the usual terrain plus a few bonus trails for tomorrow’s early morning delights. Something folks may not know, is that Sugarloaf keeps 3-5 mechanics on full-time. Just to keep our machines returning to the hill every night. They fix anything from windshield wipers to reattaching blown hydraulics, and sometimes have to figure out how to get a broken machine down to the garage or simply fix it on the mountain with the harsh elements of Sugarloaf.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for increasing clouds with low temps reaching around 20 degrees. Winds remain moderate. Tomorrow calls for snow showers throughout the day with temperatures in the mid 20’s with winds SW 15-35mph. Snow showers persist into Thursday night before clearing up for Friday. This weekend brings in a weak system, warm temperatures, then we receive another round of cold air for Sunday. Get your snow dances going again because for now things are looking dryish.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
