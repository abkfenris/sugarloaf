<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> Mother Nature continues to play her games and toy with our emotions. Last night she dropped two inches of the creamy desirables on us. Then sometime early this morning she decided to sprinkle some gram crackers on the top to give it just a little bit of a crunch. By the looks of our forecast for this weekend I’d be willing to bet a lot of ya’ll have been doing your snow dancing, your prayers, and your sacrifices because there are early indications that old man winter might just be slightly satisfied.  </p>
<p>The snowmakers will continue to enjoy their time off and getting to enjoy the fruits of their labor. After all it is the love and passion for snow sliding the mountain that draws people to work and live here. The grooming team was out last night hitting all of our open terrain.</p>
<p>Weather calls for warm temps in the mid-to-upper 30’s, winds 15-40mph, cloudy skies, with continuing mixed to showery precipitation through the day. Precip winds down throughout the day into tonight. Friday looks to be a warmer day with temperatures starting to descend later in the day to reach a low of the upper teens Friday night. Then it’s looking increasingly more likely that we are going to get hit with our first major winter storm Saturday night, early forecast totals call for 4-7 inches. Now if that just doesn’t make you feel better you might just might want to consider moving to Texas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Also on Saturday is our annual <a href="/events-calendar/tree-lighting-festival" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tree Lighting Festival</a>—and Santa Claus will be coming to town, accompanied by Amos and friends! Come celebrate the season in Sugarloaf style with warm treats, music on the Beach, fireworks, and more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Travel Safely,</span></p>
