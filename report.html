<p>Good mornings Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The last few days here at the Sugarloaf have been less than harmonious with Mother Nature letting us know who’s boss. With calm winds, warm temps, and our dedicated grooming team, you can ski today and really appreciate the glorious invention of the modern Snow Grooming Machine.</p>
<p>The snow cat operators were on the hill last night working the magic of those machines and turning a death-defying, slide-for-life surface into an enjoyable and shreddable surface. You’ll find groomed terrain from West Mountain over to Widowmaker. Ski Patrol was forced into closing quite a few trails yesterday due to detrimental conditions. It only takes, as we found last week, 8-10” of new snow to cover up that undesirable surface and bring your favorite bump runs back to life.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for cloudy skies, temps in the mid-20s, and moderate winds 15-35mph. These speeds should allow full lift operations for today. Tonight brings cooling temperatures and a chance of light flurries. Thursday is looking to bring clear skies, warm temperatures, and wind ahead of a storm cycle that is going to affect us this weekend. More on that this afternoon but it’s looking better and better as the days go by, so keep your fingers crossed, your snow dances vigorous, and your sacrifices worthy.</p>
<p> Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
