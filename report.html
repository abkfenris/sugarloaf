<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> Well today Mother Nature certainly showed us who's boss. Raging winds shook builds, knocked over small people, and battered our mountain without reprieve. However, a lot of times it seems to be true that things get worse before they get better. With decreasing winds, holiday events, and the arrival of a cold winter storm tomorrow we have no reason to despair over this past week’s weather.</p>
<p>Tonight the grooming department has much to accomplish. The snowpack is currently freezing, allowing our snowcat squad to head out in full force to start grinding it up into that nice fast frozen granular we all are so accustomed to riding.  The snowmaking crew is on stand-by watching the temperatures closely to be able to pounce at first opportunity. When it’s time, they’ll be firing up Skidder, Boardwalk, Whiffletree, and Ramdown.</p>
<p>Tonight's temperatures are forecasted to drop into the teens and single digits. Winds will remain blustery in the 30-50mph range. Tomorrow we will see decreasing winds in the 20-40mph range, daytime temps in the low twenties, and increasing clouds. Snowfall will start to develop at the end of the day so plan accordingly for your travel Saturday night. Currently, we are anticipating 4-6” of the white fluffy goodness that we are all craving. Make sure to catch us right here at the mountain report in the morning for all the latest details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Join us on Saturday for our annual <a href="/events-calendar/tree-lighting-festival" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tree Lighting Festival</a>—and Santa Claus will be coming to town, accompanied by Amos and friends! Come celebrate the season in Sugarloaf style with warm treats, music on the Beach, fireworks, and more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Travel safely,</span></p>
