<p>G’day Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>There’s no such thing as the Sunday scaries when you have up to a foot plus of snow on the way. We’re expected to see 8-14 inches of natural tomorrow, with free refills on tap throughout the day. Be sure to get a good night’s rest and eat your Wheaties in the morning since this will be our first major storm of the season. If you’re looking for some additional stoke tonight you can stream for free on YouTube the 1996 Warren Miller’s Snow Riders, which has an epic intro that is guaranteed to fire up even the saltiest and most jaded of skiers.</p>
<p>Snowmaking operations will begin wrapping up this afternoon while mother nature takes the reigns. Favorable conditions over the last few days have allowed the piles to really compound out there, with Sidewinder about prime for sculpting into the legendary baked turns that it is known for. The grooming team will head out on the mountain tonight to prepare the mountain for tomorrow’s storm.</p>
<p>This evening’s forecast calls for rising temperatures and moderate South to South-East winds coming ranging from 20-40mph. The flakeage is slated to kick off before sunrise tomorrow, picking in intensity around opening bell (which is 8:30am for the newbies out there). It’ll be nuke city throughout the day with steady accumulation forecast though last chair, plan accordingly. Currently, we are expected to see all snow, with the possibility of things switching over to a more mixed state as the storm moves out in the late evening hours.</p>
<p>Pack your powder skirt, and I will see you out there. <br/>Noelle</p>
