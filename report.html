<p style="text-align: justify;">Good morning Sugarloaf skiers and riders, and happy New Year’s Eve to you!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those spending the last day of 2021 here at Sugarloaf, dress for temperatures in the 20s at the summit with 30s by the base. The forecast suggests we’ll see snow showers in the AM, with a possibility of it turning to mixed precipitation in afternoon; those heading to the hill will be taking turns under mostly cloudy skies with winds up to 20 MPH from the SW.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have 10 lifts scheduled to spin today, including my personal favorite, King Pine, which opened earlier this week, offering more options of prime-time terrain to take turns on! The latest addition to our list of opening runs is Choker, bringing our total to 41 trails—that’s 232 acres for you to explore in your on-hill adventures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overnight, our tireless team of groomers headed to the hill to deliver a little TLC to 36 trails, including Choker, Ramdown, Tohaul, and Whiffletree. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking ahead, another front is expected to arrive this evening, just in time to ring in <a href="/events-calendar/new-years-eve-x23906" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the New Year!</a> We’ll be kicking off the evening with a kids’ celebration in the King Pine Room; there will be a juggling workshop at 7:00pm, followed by a live performance by AudioBody at 8:00pm. Fireworks will set off from The Landing at 9:00pm, with live music by the band Skosh in The Widowmaker starting at 9:30pm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In other good news, one night stays are now available for tonight and tomorrow in both the hotel and condos. Visit <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/booklodging">Reservations | Sugarloaf</a> to reserve yours!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the rest of the weekend, we expect to start 2022 with more unsettled weather heading our way late Saturday into Sunday. While it’s too soon to say with any certainty, the forecast suggests we’ll see a mixed bag of rain, snow, and everything in-between—but don’t worry, Sugarloafers: we’ll keep an eye on it for you and provide any updates for you right here in the Mountain Report. Who knows? Maybe all the (snow)dancing in The Widowmaker tonight will swing this front in our favor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Snowmaking operations will be offline until Sunday. Expanding terrain continues to be the name of the game, so when the team gets the guns going again, their work will focus on Haulback and Sidewinder—and once Haulback is good to go, their plan is to begin blasting West Mountain into a world of white.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See you on the slopes,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gabby</p>
