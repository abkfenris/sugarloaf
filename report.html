<p><strong>UPDATE: Due to Conditions. Ungroomed terrain is recommended for expert skiers only. -8:53am</strong></p>
<p>Happy game day,</p>
<p>If you’re feeling a little slow and groggy this morning because of a night of spirits and delights. Do not let others pester you into your ski boots right away. Have a coffee and a bite and enjoy the relaxation of a final slow-paced morning before heading into the midst of another work week.</p>
<p>The grooming team has their work cut out for them this morning dealing with the conditions the weather has set before them. With temperatures dropping to the single digits overnight. Yesterday’s wet snow has now consolidated into a surface that the ski racers will enjoy. When Ski Patrol comes in they will assess the trails for safety, I would not be surprised if they made the call to close some terrain. Today the lift department has 11 lifts scheduled to turn from West Mountain to King Pine.</p>
<p>Cold air has moved in overnight and put an end to the quiet skiing we have enjoyed the last 2ish weeks. Clouds will decrease to partly sunny skies with temps reaching a high of around 15 degrees at the base and singles at the top. Winds remain standard in the 20-40mph range, unlikely to affect lift operations today. The cold remains in place early in the week. And the rest of it we’ll just try and blissfully ignore until reality comes knocking.</p>
<p>Go Bengals,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
