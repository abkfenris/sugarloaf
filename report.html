<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Bring your chapstick, neck buff, and a kite with you today to ensure maximum enjoyment on the slopes. We’ve got some warm temperatures, wind, and sunny skies on tap for the day, with 7 lifts scheduled to whisk you around the mountain to our 320 acres of available terrain.</p>
<p>The grooming team hit the hill last night and set out to get more terrain open for our mid-week skiing delights. Last night they added Wedge and Flume to the rounds and will be open for today. The lift department is currently on the hill observing winds 30-40mph with gusts to 60mph at the top of Skyline, which will start the day on Wind Hold.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for clear skies, temps in the upper 20s to mid-30s, with continued strong winds in the 25-50mph range with higher gusts. Temps drop of overnight to a low of the upper teens around the base while winds persist. Friday brings diminishing winds and flurries set in ahead of our next storm system affecting us mainly on Saturday. Early snow totals call for 4-8 inches which is most certainly welcome. However, the snow line remains very close to Sugarloaf and there is a chance from some brief mixing during the height of the storm, but the majority of precipitation is to fall as wet and heavy snow which is perfect to cover up the hard pack left in the wake of the last storm.</p>
<p>Remember to keep an eye out here at the mountain report(scroll down for lift status) or<a href="https://twitter.com/SugarloafSnow"> @sugarloafsnow</a> on Twitter for all the most recent lift updates.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
