<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>It is impressive to drive up Rt. 27, go around “oh my gosh” corner, and still see the white snowy trails proudly sticking out of the clouds. Today we’ll have SuperQuad and Skyline servicing 300+ acres of terrain, go poke around, and have an adventure. Just because east side lifts are closed, it doesn’t mean the trails are.</p>
<p>The groomers last night groomed out Tote Road, while maintaining connections and lift access. And as is common this time of year, you should expect surfaces to be pretty firm in the mornings, before they loosen up later in the day as temps rise. These freeze thaw cycles make for great corn snow, but they also mean that you may find some trails roped off in the mornings until snow softens enough for Ski Patrol to open them up. During this time of year, the open trail count you see on this report is a reflection of the trails we expect to open at some point during the day, once surfaces soften.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for a quarter to a half inch of rain, 20-30mph winds, with temps in the low 40s. Tonight's temperatures cool to below as precipitations changes over to a snowy mix leaving us with the possibility of 2-4” for Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
