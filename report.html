<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Our beautiful mountain is now showing her true colors with a foot of natural snow early in the week. Ski Patrol has been on a rampant rope-rippin’ rampage the last few days. Giving us all the opportunity to test our mid-January ski muscles on some un-groomed trails with soft and delicious bumps.  Today we are looking at 69 trails, 6 lifts, over 364 acres of terrain.</p>
<p>The grooming team deployed on the mountain last night to buff out the hill focusing on our beginner and intermediate terrain. The snowmaking team is off until Friday due to unfavorable winds. They plan to fire up equipment on Gondi Line, Upper Timberline, and Drop Line.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for snow showers starting this morning with the possibility of dropping a couple of inches of snow which will be icing on the cake to our already scrumptious powdery surface. Temps are moderate in the upper teens, as well with winds in the 20-35mph range. Tonight isolated snow showers continue as temperatures remain in the upper teens while winds elevate and switch directions. Looking down the road the cold pattern persists through the end of the month, with a chance of a small clipper event affecting us this weekend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Happy Snow Riding,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
