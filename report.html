<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The sun is shining bright and the temperatures are moderating into the teens making for a wonderful day on the hill. The grooming department stayed overtime to finish off as much terrain as they could, but alas could not get to it all.  With snowfall in the forecast and our<a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/events-calendar/fire-on-the-mountain"> Fire on the Mountain</a> event celebrating the music of the Grateful Dead. This is going to be a perfect weekend to shelve the worries of the week and create memories to put in the <em>Attics of your Life</em>.</p>
<p>The snowmaking department hit the hill this morning and got snow guns fired up on Upper Narrow Gauge, Upper Tote Road, and a few guns around Bullwinkles to keep us skiing to that beautiful sunny porch well into the spring season. Tonight they’ll move some resources to Bridal Chain, Timberline, and Candyside. The grooming team will again be hitting the hill hard tonight and coating most of our on-piste terrain with velvety corduroy for tomorrow’s grateful shred.</p>
<p>Weather tonight calls for diminishing winds and cold temps. Friday brings us the onset of a much-needed snowstorm, slated to start affecting the area around 8-9 am. Snow will consistently fall throughout the day where we are expecting 4-7 inches of snow total by the time things wrap up Friday night. </p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
<p>P.S. Bring your dancing shoes!</p>
