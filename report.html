<p style="text-align: justify;">We made it through our first torturous morning of not being able to go skiing at 8:30am; however, fortunately for us, this problem was easily put into perspective. Thankfully we have our dedicated Lift Mechanic crew, who fight the cold, wind, and ice during such events to conduct regular checks to determine if the lifts are safe for humanoid passage or not. So, if you’re on your game for this weekend and close to Sugarloaf, you’ll be able to snag those tasty lasties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today our snowmakers relished in the lashing winds and were able to begin operations on Spillway, Lower Winter’s Way, and the Birches. Since we're looking at a cold night ahead, you can count that things will pile up quickly. Spillway, in my eyes, is a Sugarloaf Ultra-Classic. Its steep, sustained fall line, mostly groomed but partially moguled, gives the skier or rider every bit of opportunity to push and test their skills<span>–</span>as well as stroke their ego in view of the Skyline lift, inviting lift riders to freely enjoy, judge, and occasionally get to view a free clinic at their leisure. The grooming team has their work cut out for them tonight to buff out all the wind-swept terrain we have available, plus smoothing out Sluice, Gin Pole, Lower Winter’s, and the Skyline load for the season debut of the Skyline lift. <strong>Expect to be able to ride the Skyline lift starting at 10:00am tomorrow!</strong></p>
<p>Tonight the temperatures will continue to plunge into the low teens at the base and low single digits at the summit. The powerful winds responsible for this cold air will begin to diminish in the early morning hours of Saturday. As we enter into daylight tomorrow, the worst of the winds will be gone, leaving us with gusts to only the mid 30s at the summit. Clouds will be in and out, giving way to pockets of sun, which are sure to have us a real dandy of a day coming our way.</p>
<p>TLDR: Windy day today. Cold windy night ahead. Diminishing winds and clouds with pockets of sun tomorrow, with temps in the high teens. Snowmaking on Spillway, Lower Winters, and the Birches. Debut Skyline lift and more terrain, with Gin Pole, Sluice, Lower Winter’s and the Landing, bringing us operating with 18 trails serviced by 4 lifts.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that there will be no beginner terrain available from the top of either lift. uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em></p>
<p>Catch you right here in the afternoon,</p>
