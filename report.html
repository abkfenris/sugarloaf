<p><strong>7:45AM UPDATE: <em>Elevated wind gusts are impacting lift operations. Scroll down to the lift report for the latest updates. </em></strong></p>
<p>Top of the morning to you, Sugarloafers.</p>
<p>Mother Nature has pulled a complete 180 from yesterday’s sunshine and 50-degree temperatures, but what better way to celebrate spring than with, quite possibly, the last snowstorm of the season. Forecasts are calling for up to a half-foot of accumulation throughout the day today, but we've seen these late-season storms overperform at higher elevations in the past, so I wouldn’t be surprised if snow totals are more than double that at the top of the SuperQuad.</p>
<p>The flakeage started around 6:30 this morning, and we expect to see in continue through last chair. The storm front has brought with it some elevated wind gusts, which may impact lift operations, so be sure to check the lift report below for current lift status before heading up the hill. And if you're looking ahead through the final two weeks of the season here, you can see our <a href="/spring-operations-schedule">anticipated spring lift operations schedule right here</a>.</p>
<p>Our groomers are just finishing up their work on the usual spring suspects between Tote Road and Gondi Line, but with free refills on tap throughout the day, you’ll be hard-pressed to make a turn that doesn’t feel good out there today.</p>
<p>And in case you missed it yesterday, Sugarloafer Myles Silverman set a new Guinness World Record for most vertical feet snowboarded in 12 hours, logging 56 laps and 95,088 total vertical.</p>
<p>That’s all for now. Check back for another update this afternoon, and I will see you out there. <br/>Noelle</p>
