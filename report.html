<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>This morning bluebird skies, cool temperatures, and swirling snow let us know that winter isn’t quite over yet, and if you have started your garden early you might be in for a true scramble for Tuesday comes. With 3-5 inches of snow still a possibility for Tuesday it might just be a bit of motivation for you to come up and enjoy another day of snow riding at Sugarloaf.</p>
<p>The grooming team tonight will hit the hill and groom terrain from Tote Road over to Widowmaker. With King Pine closing for the season this afternoon and Cross Haul pretty much melted out at this point, it appears we are waving goodbye to the King Pine bowl for the season.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for some additional showers to hit the area through the first part of the night. Eventually skies clear out completely and make way for a beautiful sunny Monday. Tomorrow expects high temps to reach the low 50s around the base and 40 degrees at the summit. Winds will be moderate from the SW tomorrow at speeds from 20-40mph. Tuesday is still looking at the possibility of 3-5 inches of snow accumulating throughout the morning. Wednesday skies are clear and the active weather pattern seems to withdraw for a while with warm dry days in the mid-40s and nighttime temps dropping to the low 30s.</p>
<p>Stay Tuned,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
