<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Yesterday delivered the powder and today will bring delicious groomers and stashes from West Mountain to the Far East. With the addition of Brackett Basin and numerous other glades and trails, Sugarloaf is really coming into her true colors offering 115 trails, 619 acres of open terrain, and all lifts scheduled to turn.</p>
<p>The grooming department hit the hill last and busted up all the bumps everyone made yesterday and turned it into creamy corduroy. They also were able to push out the gigantic whales on Sluice Headwall to prepare for opening today. Make sure to check below for a detailed trail report for today so you don’t find yourself pounding through soft moguls.</p>
<p>Today the clouds give way to partial sun and slightly elevated winds. Highs at the base will be around 13 degrees while the summit will be lucky to reach zero. The winds will reach about 40mph on the upper mountain. Saturday night temperatures drop below zero and things warm on Sunday to the teens during the day. Bring your poofy and grab that new neck buff or some swanky and warm mittens at Downhill Supply and you’ll be ready to enjoy a brisk day in the Maine Mountains.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
