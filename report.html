<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Quite a pleasant day out there on the mountain today.  Packed pow groomers and even some soft stuff to be had on the sides.  The sun has been out all day providing us with vitamin D and an improved edge.  Lift lines have recessed back into non-existence with Spring Break coming to a close.  There’s more than enough fun to go around.</p>
<p>Tonight temperatures will more or less stay cold, 0 to 4 degrees here at the base and -9 to -5 at the top.  Tomorrow it will be warmer than today with 18 to 22, SW/SSE 14-20 mph at base and 8 to 12, W/WSW 25-40 at top, and we are expecting some light snowfall in the afternoon, around 1 inch.  It’s looking like a pretty calm and chilly week overall with one other small system that is likely to roll through Thursday morning. </p>
<p>Thankfully the temperature will allow our slimmed down snowmaking crew to do some things this week.  They’ll be blowing some tactical piles tonight and over the next few days.  The grooming team is setting out tonight to groom all of Gondi Line and Gondi Extension as well as flatten out the bumps on Skidder both of which I may head straight for in the morning.  Lifts will be the weekday 8 tomorrow with Timberline, King Pine and Whiffletree open at 9:00am, the rest at 8:30am.</p>
<p>Check back in the morning for any and all updates. </p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
