<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Thank Amos it’s Friday. We have made it through another week and are heading full send into a wonderful weekend filled with the joys that the Carrabassett Valley has to offer. With live music, cat skiing, and an almost freeze-thaw cycle in place through Saturday. Things are starting to feel a little bit like what Sugarloaf is King of.</p>
<p>The grooming department hit the hill last night and groomed out the usual suspects. Expect things to be firmer and faster than they have been due to the freeze last night. However, as the day goes on the sun and air temps may warm enough to soften things up a bit.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for lots of sun temps in the upper 20s and low 30s and light winds from the southwest at 20-40 mph. Temps remain consistent through the night before starting to warm Saturday morning to right around freezing on the summit with temps in the mid-to-upper 30s around the base. Saturday sees light showers of the variety that’s not certain while winds elevate significantly to speeds of 30-55mph on the upper mountain. Sunday officially marks the end of a fortunate run of conditions at Sugarloaf when temperatures plummet to the low teens and single digits and our saturated snowpack consolidates into what we are accustomed to in east coast skiing.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
