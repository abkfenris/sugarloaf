<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Today we have ourselves another good one for those dedicated to getting their turns in.  Temperatures are slightly warmer than yesterday but high winds will be a factor.  A friend of mine once said; its days like today that you’re glad you skied when it’s 45 and sunny at the end of the season.  I'm still not entirely sure what he meant by that.</p>
<p>This morning the base is reading 10-14 with WNW winds of 15-30mph.  Temperature at the top is -3-1 with WNW winds of 35-55mph.  Skies should be partly cloudy again today but the sun always seems to make an appearance lately. </p>
<p>Sugarloaf Grooming did more of what they do best last night - keeping that corduroy nice and soft for those eager enough to pursue it.  Lifts will be running consistent with the weekday schedule with Sawduster, Snubber, DRC East, Superquad and Skyline at 8:30am and King Pine, Timberline and Whiffletree at 9:00am.  Sugarloaf Terrain Parks team is trying to figure out the best course of action for opening Dropline Park before February break gets here, but our other five parks- Boardwalk, Sidewinder, Spurline, Stomping Ground and Upper Tote Park are maintained and reshaped on a weekly to bi-weekly basis.  </p>
<p>Although cover hardened up over the past few days, I’ve been enjoying some incredible runs.  So much of the mountain opened during those big snowfalls we got over the past two weeks that I still feel like I’m finding new snow and hitting trails for the first time this season.</p>
<p>Should be a great day for weekday skiers so let’s go enjoy the hard and fast laps while we can.</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
