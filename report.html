<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Having made it by another hump day we can reasonably look forward to a fun and festive weekend at Sugarloaf. With the Charity Summit, Women’s Ride Day, and a big storm brewing you can count on a stimulating mind-vacation in our beautiful little corner of the world.</p>
<p>The grooming team set out on a mission to groom everything with the exception of the King Pine Bowl, Skidder, and Spillway. Due to unfavorable winds and the likelihood of equipment being buried, the snowmakers remain offline and expect to get things fired up again on Sunday. The STP crew continues to refine existing parks and sculpt out Drop Line and Sidewinder. The Ski Patrollers maintain high hopes and prepare the mountain for more snow by setting the stage to drop more ropes as soon as conditions allow.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for a frigid start with gradually warming temperatures. Sunny skies with a few clouds will prevail today with temps around 13 degrees at the base and 6 degrees at the summit. Winds are present at the base in the 12-18mph range and moderate on the upper mountain around 30-45mph. With the wind and cold temperatures present in the upper mountain make sure to cover up as wind chills are well below zero up high. Currently, 8-12 inches of snow is forecasted in “high confidence” for Sugarloaf this weekend starting mid-day Saturday and persisting until some point on Sunday.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
