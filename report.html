<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p><em>Fare the well</em> dead heads, it was a magical weekend of snow riding and music. Although it is sad that we’ll have to wait a whole year for the next Fire on the Mountain. We’ll have all the beautiful <em>days between </em>to remember the <em>people joining and in hand, while the music played the band. </em></p>
<p>The snowmaking crew wrapped things up this morning on the summit and the grooming team will hit the hill <em>till the morning comes</em> and create a top shelf ski surface for tomorrow’s early birds.</p>
<p>As <em>we</em> <em>bid you goodnight</em> temps will plummet down to a low of -4 degrees at the base. While the winds continue to crank away 40-60mph at the summit. Monday brings partially sunny skies, moderate winds 35-45mph, and temps reaching a high of 10 around the base. With<em> so many roads to ride, </em>it’s time to <em>ramble on rose.</em></p>
<p>If you ever get those <em>U.S Blues and </em>feel the need to <em>stir it up</em> a bit too <em>lively up yourself </em>plan to come play under sun with us and experience the<a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/events-calendar/reggae-fest"> 34<sup>th</sup> Annual Reggae Festival April 7<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup></a>. Also if you’re embarking on the long journey home and crave some more Grateful Dead. Check out two of my favorite live performances at the Oxford Plains Speedway in Oxford, Maine <a href="https://archive.org/details/gd88-07-02.sbd-matrix.dan.21211.sbeok.shnf">July 2<sup>nd</sup></a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/gd88-07-03.sbd.ststephen.3908.sbeok.shnf">3</a><sup><a href="https://archive.org/details/gd88-07-03.sbd.ststephen.3908.sbeok.shnf">rd</a>  </sup>1988.
