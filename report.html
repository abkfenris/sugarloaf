<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Whether you were racing or recreationally riding today; it was an amazing day out there.  Without a cloud in sight, it just kept getting warmer and calmer out there all day.  The snow has softened up enough to get those edges in, but firm enough to keep ripping.  Men's Giant Slalom runs are happening throughout the day.  Click here to see who found themselves on the podium and to check out the preview for tomorrow’s final event of the Toyota US Alpine National Championships – Women’s Giant Slalom. </p>
<p>Temperatures are rising fast this afternoon and will remain in the 20’s tonight which should allow for some pristine grooming.  In the early AM hours tonight we are expecting a light mix of snow/sleet to accumulate no more than an inch.</p>
<p>On the list to be groomed is the usual as of late – everything under Spillway Crosscut.  Tomorrow we will have the same 7 lifts as today: SuperQuad, Skyline, Snubber, Skidway and DRC East at 8:30am followed by King Pine and Whiffletree at 9:00am. </p>
<p>Tomorrow we are expecting an even warmer day with predicted highs of 36 degrees at the top and 38 degrees at the base.  Wind will be a factor and we will also be dealing with potentially precipitation carrying clouds in the afternoon.  We’re thinking it will start late enough in the day as to not affect tomorrow’s skiing but we are expecting it to come down as a layer of ice in the late afternoon before any rain makes it decent, so it shouldn’t hurt our snow coverage much at all.  More updates to come so stay tuned tomorrow morning for more details.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
