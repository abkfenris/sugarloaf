<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Another Monday in the books with this one turning out to be a beautiful day.  Most notably today marks the resumption of snowmaking on the hill.  With about a hundred guns running all day today we got blessed with dang near perfect temperature for it and almost no wind.  That translates to big piles of  cushy snow support</p>
<p>The natural snow conditions got firmer and faster overnight – likely exactly what many racers were hoping for.  I had a blast doing full length cruisers down Tote Road through the rollers and hitting most of Timberline top to bottom via Skyline.  It was really fun out there; certainly a relief from the wetness we’ve been experiencing lately and also a great day to get some sun.</p>
<p>Tonight it will stay cold with temps of 1-5 at top and 11-15 at base.  Snowmaking is shutting down tonight and will be off the mountain by morning.  Not before they get some snow on Pinch, Bridle Chain, and bottom of Candyside.  Grooming will hit the usual stuff and will also plan to squeeze in White Nitro from Spillway Crosscut down.  Lifts for tomorrow will be the same 7 as today, no Timberline.</p>
<p>The front half of this week will stay cold-ish, in that sweet 20's range, but we’ll be back up into the 30’s Thursday and Friday.  We are watching for precipitation that will likely be sporadic from Wednesday night through Friday.  Let us keep our eye on it and don’t forget to tune in for more updates.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
