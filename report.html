<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Wowzers all that snow is leaving me with wobbly legs and a full spirit. Today turned out quite nice and another inch of snow overnight really left conditions in prime form. Things were so soft that even the groomed trails started fielding soft and poppable bumps before long. With more sun and warmer temperatures on tap for tomorrow, we are in for another stand-out day here at Sugarloaf.</p>
<p>Tonight the groomers will again tackle the hill and try and pack in the piste terrain delivering soft and supple groomers for tomorrow’s early birds. The corduroy first thing this morning was heavenly, and with a frigid night ahead I’m expecting the groomers to be soft, crisp, and fast tomorrow. Snowmaking continues their break and is expected to return this week and finish our last trails on the summit. White Nitro, Gondi, and Narrow Gauge Extensions.</p>
<p>The temperatures tonight drop to disappointing lows however are on track to quickly recover during the day tomorrow, leaving us with single digits at the summit and teens around the base. Winds are slightly stronger tomorrow in the 20-45mph range. Skies start out sunny tomorrow then clouds begin to increase into the night. Looking ahead the storm track looks quiet as high pressure begins to settle into the area leaving us with sunny days in the upper 20s and nights that drop into the teens. Cheers to all you Sugarloafers out there battling the soreness associated with powder days and keeping it real until the bell.</p>
<p>Have an awesome night,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
