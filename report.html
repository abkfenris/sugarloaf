<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Update</strong>: As of 11:00am, King Pine remains on wind hold.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Monday began with a blizzard, which dropped a foot of snow on our slopes and allowed ski patrol to drop ropes on 13 new trails, including fan-favorite Gondi Line<span>–</span>what a strong way to start the week! Plus, in addition to adding to our terrain totals, the 12 inches of accumulation really helped top off our other open trails. Today’s weather is going to be another fine example of Old Man Winter exerting his strength, with dropping temperatures this Tuesday and elevated winds as the winter storm gets pushed out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There's no doubt about it, it's sure to have another busy day, and the cleanup crews were hard at work overnight to ensure the approach to Sugarloaf is looking nice. Hey, it’s a good way to start the day when you can just glide into parking and pop your skis off the rack! As for the grooming department, they're scheduled to get everything they had planned for the night, so make sure to wake up bright and early and ready for another great day, taking advantage of what the storm gave us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Temperatures sure did drop overnight, landing in the single digits at the summit, and will continue to drop throughout the day down into the negatives (we expect to see temps at the summit reach around -9 today), so please make sure to wear good base layers and warm mitts, as well as drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated! The base temps are cruising towards a balmy, right-on-the-money zero degrees, with winds of 25 MPH coming from the NW.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you didn't get here yesterday and can't get here today, don't fret: we'll be reaping the benefits of this storm all week long at the Loaf. Even better still, you can save a bundle on lodging and lift tickets with our <a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.e.sugarloaf.com%2F%3Fqs%3D5c592dd6d62123bd940335275fb40fd210dcab3febecb8e9bd198551fb80d959a50dfe47944c2c77600eb416718ffe6a7392ca4f02679b1b0a8a7ccdabbf4feb&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cgmartin%40sugarloaf.com%7C5e5d797a652d4b8fc4da08d9d9e22bb8%7C20fea68a11ec4b24a9055061d8e916d0%7C0%7C0%7C637780387712673640%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=Mf8l8vX96HtZhsDnlKtOmPhIXRYCSYacrAMFdxr7mng%3D&amp;reserved=0">Five Day Sale</a>, happening right now.</p>
