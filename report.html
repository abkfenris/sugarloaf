<p><strong>Update: King Pine has been put on wind hold to start the day.</strong></p>
<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Today marks day two of our final week of nationals racing here at Sugarloaf.  Excitement continues today with championship Slalom runs scheduled for our U.S. National Alpine Championship competitors.  It’s incredible having so many talented skiers all over the mountain and to see the professionalism of all these athletes.  Special shout-out to fellow New Hampshire native Zoe Zimmerman for coming away with first place yesterday in the U21 Women’s Slalom NorAm Cup Final.  Congrats Zoe!</p>
<p>The forecast today predicts temperatures of 22-26 at base, 8-12 at top.  Moderate winds are also expected so it will be worth having that extra layer when you’re at the top of SuperQuad.  Snow conditions should be quite similar to yesterday as the temperature dropped down to the single digits again last night.  For competition purposes today, we are in luck, and should expect some fast times.</p>
<p>Grooming set out last night on their usual weekday hits and were able to push around those piles that got blown yesterday so that should soften up a few trails.  Snowmaking was wrapped up overnight so there shouldn’t be any guns blowing today.  For lifts today we have the same 7 scheduled that ran yesterday: SuperQuad, Skyline, Snubber, Skidway and DoubleRunner at 8:30am followed by Whiffletree and King Pine at 9:00am. </p>
<p>This will be the coldest day of the rest of the week, with temps set to hit the 40’s potentially on Thursday and Friday.  Some precipitation is also expected in the latter half of the week so we’ll just have to wait and see what form it comes in.  So break out your sharpest edges today while everything is firm and go have a blast.</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
