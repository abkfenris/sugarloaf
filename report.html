<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Jimmy cracked corn today and I’m here to tell you that we all cared. Cooler temperatures overnight left things with a little crust first off this morning, however, warm temperatures and sunshine showed up to the party and quickly had everyone riding the sweet spot in the corn cycle.</p>
<p>The grooming team will hit the hill tonight and groom out a variety of terrain for tomorrow’s spring-riding pleasantries. Expect a trail or two to be groomed from the top of each lift as we enjoy King of Spring. Click <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/spring-operations-schedule">here</a> to check our lift schedule.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for clouds to move in with the onset of another system that appears to affect us through the weekend. This one is looking colder, possibly bringing snow showers up top with a mix to rain down towards the base. Winds tomorrow come around to the Southwest at speeds ranging from 25-40mph. Sunday weather looks to clear up slightly with isolated rain/snow showers expected throughout the day. Monday is looking clear and warm as another storm system moves into the area that could possibly bring us what we have been missing in March/April.</p>
<p>Tomorrow Pond Skimming champions will take to our new venue at the bottom of Dropline and skim their way to glory. Registration is 9-10:30 and the first racers start at 11 am.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
