<p><b>9:02AM UPDATE: Whiffletree Open. Skyline, SuperQuad, King Pine, Timberline on wind hold. </b></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Arctic air and strong winds have moved into the area. Luckily we live in 2022 and we have the comforts of modern insulation, Gore-Tex, and electrically heated boots. I think of the loggers who used the names of our trails in everyday speech cutting and transporting the logs through the woods to the rivers and lakes by oxen and horse team. Out in thicket eating biscuits and salted pork. Setting out into the frozen forest with leather and wool to contribute to the growth of America. We are indeed spoiled.</p>
<p>Snowmakers last night maintained operations on Sidewinder, Comp Hill, and Chicken Pitch. The Grooming department spread out across the hill and managed to tackle all of our major trails. The lift maintenance crew is out checking wind speeds and determining lift status, and so far it’s looking like Skyline is starting out on wind hold.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for cold and wind. Temps at the base will reach a high of around 0 while the summit endures temps around -12. Winds remain strong blowing 20-40mph at the base and 55-75mph at the summit. Gusts of 60 were recorded at TOS this morning.  The skies are clear. Tonight looks more of the same with winds slightly diminishing into Sunday which is looking to be a dandy of a day with full sun and winds 20-40mph and temps in the single digits. We are still closely watching the storm due for Monday and it appears we are still on track to receive 8-12” as a storm total. Don’t stop snow dancing just yet because a lot can still change in the next few days. If you’re out and about skiing today make sure to cover all skin and regularly check each other for signs of frostbite.</p>
<p>Stay warm,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
