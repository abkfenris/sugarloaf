<p>Good morning Pow Riders,</p>
<p>And holy guacamole Barbra, we’ve got some snow. With 10” piled up at the base and the storm in complete hammer mode. I do think we are going to see well over a foot of snow from this storm. Talking with groomers this morning they are reporting lots of snow and an insignificant breeze. You can bet that today will likely go down as one of the best ski and ride days of 2022.</p>
<p>Last night the grooming team tackled limited terrain and allowed the storm to blanket our mountain in Mother Nature finest. They did hit a bunch of lower terrain and a few trails like Sluice, Tote Road, Timberline, Ramdown, and the Whiffletree area. Preliminary checks by the lift maintenance crew are coming in and winds are reported 25-35mph at TOS, and Skyline is clear for operations. We are looking at a full lift schedule today to get everyone into their favorite powder stashes from Horseshoe to as far east as Ski Patrol can get us, Burnt is the Limit.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for glory, and continued snow with another 4-8” possible throughout the day. Temps remain moderate in the teens, and winds forecasted from the SW at 15-25mph. Snowfall lingers into tonight and temperatures trickle down to the single digits, leading us into a cold and sunny Saturday. If you can’t make the trip today and your boss didn’t buy your half-baked excuse to miss work, I grant you the serenity to accept the things you cannot change. And to rest assured that we’ll have you in our thoughts and tomorrow will also be a wonderful day.</p>
<p>The roads are slick and snowy and there are snow removal workers everywhere.  Please drive carefully and take your time. You don’t want to be the Joseph Smith that is stuck in a snowy ditch while all the other soon-to-be powder skiers drive by you.</p>
<p>Prepare yourselves for greatness,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chris</p>
