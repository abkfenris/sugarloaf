<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Update</strong>: Skyline, the SuperQuad, and Timberline will  remain on wind hold 10:00am</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People always say the early bird gets the worm, but I’m always curious: what happens when the worm sleeps in? It seems like winter is finally here, and here to stay. As snow flurries poke around the mountain this morning and the temperatures are seeming to drop for the week, the joy of holiday cheer and decorations around the Valley are heart-warming, and thoughts of family time around the mountain is exciting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking of exciting, we are always excited to have trails freshly groomed and ready for first tracks from our dedicated skiers and riders, and today is no different. I love seeing the groomers crawl around the mountain at night, knowing that they are setting things up for a great first run. The snowmakers are working hard and taking advantage of the weather as we push to the east side of the mountain and continue to work our way up Whiffletree and Ramdown as well as Lombard and Spillway X-Cut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, we'll be waking up and brushing our cars off from the light snow showers; the sky will begin to clear up as the day progresses, and hopefully we'll see a little sun today. We have some highs early this morning of around 30 degrees by the base, but giving way to the high teens this afternoon and continuing to drop throughout the night; the summit is riding the same boat, with temps in the high teens that will drop through the day Winds are looking mild at the peak, elevating to around 50 mph around noon and then slowly fading out through the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As always, we look forward to seeing you enjoy the day skiing or riding at Sugarloaf, and would love to see your experiences on social media!</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>David</p>
