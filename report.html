<p>Good day Sugarloafers,</p>
<p><em>Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world.</em> And what those eyes will behold today is quite beautiful. Mother Nature has set us up with an ideal day of shredding with 6 fresh inches of snow yesterday, warming temps, and full sunshine for today. So <em>Turn on your Love Light </em>and get all <em>tangled up in blue </em>with us here at Sugarloaf today.</p>
<p>Last night the grooming team was hard at work while all the hippies were boogying the night away. They were able to cover some ground getting almost all on-piste trails from West Mountain to Haulback. The snowmaking team last night enjoyed some ideal cold conditions with low wind speeds and made snow on Upper Narrow Gauge, White Nitro Ext., and Gondi Extension.</p>
<p>Last night<em> in the shadows of the moon</em> temperatures dropped to lows around zero at the base leaving things quite chilly here this morning. However, with full sun today we are expected things to warm up quickly to the upper teens and low 20s. Winds are forecasted in the moderate range from 25-40mph from the west.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/events-calendar/fire-on-the-mountain"> Fire on the Mountain</a> festivities start back up again this afternoon with a free all ages show with the Widowmaker All-Stars at the Widowmaker at 2pm.  Three more bands are set the take stages later in the night at the King Pine room and the Widowmaker. With <em>so many roads to ease your soul</em> you’ll be guaranteed to have a <em>high time. </em></p>
<p><em>Settle down easy,</em></p>
<p>Chris</p>
