<p style="text-align: justify;">Good morning Sugarloafers, and happy Boxing Day!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The snowmakers are blowing and snowcats are crawling, setting us up with another beautiful day of skiing and riding. The storm that was supposed to affect us yesterday and last night never really showed up on our slopes, though it did gift us with a generous dusting. With some pleasant weather afoot, sprawling terrain, and the last days of 2021 upon us, it’s time to blow off a little holiday steam and treat yourself to some fresh mountain air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Snowmakers battled the food comas of Christmas feasts and continued making snow on the East Side operating on Widowmaker, Choker, Flume, and Tohaul; meanwhile, the grooming fleet headed out to deliver a little TLC to all of our open terrain, plus flattening the whales and laying corduroy on Skidder top-to-bottom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today the weather will remain benign with scattered snow showers this morning, temps in the mid 20’s, and calm winds around 10-15 mph. As clouds move out tonight, temperatures drop to the teens and winds pick up with gusts up to 40 mph at the summit. Monday looks to be a nice day, with sun and temps in the 20s, which always is a good time to come enjoy some skiing and ride with us at Sugarloaf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Safe travels,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris</p>
