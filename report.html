<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p><br/>Man, I got to say that it was such a hoot skiing and snapping photos of ya’ll today. I saw many friends, families, and groups smiling away, enjoying each other’s company, and all the new natural snow that we picked up overnight. This is what Sugarloaf vibes and coming up here are all about.</p>
<br/>
<p>Today our snowmaking crew has been maintaining operations on Narrow Gauge from Pick Pole Crosscut to the bottom of Double Runner and across Peavey. They’re also getting gear set up on the landing so you can ski directly to and from the Widowmaker for a bite and beverage. The snow cats will again be crawling about tonight turning all them powder bumps that were reminding you of your age today into fresh, smooth, buttery enjoyment for you tomorrow morning.</p>
<br/>
<p>Tonight we’ll see the winds continue, and the temperature drop to the mid-teens as the current storm system moves out. Tomorrow look for diminishing clouds, sun, and temperatures starting in the teens in the morning. Then warming up to the low to mid-twenties for the afternoon. Temps are still looking good in the long range for continued snowmaking. Make sure to check back in here at the mountain report for all the recent updates. Happy Saturday!</p>
