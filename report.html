<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Conditions today exceeded expectations with nice granular snow that was fast and soft. Despite the fog hovering over the upper mountain all day once you got below it, you were treated to scenes of clouds lazily drifting down Carrabassett Valley. With cold temps moving in overnight the US Ski Team members present for the Alpine Championships should see favorable conditions for racing on Narrow Gauge.</p>
<p>The grooming team will again hit the hill tonight in a limited fashion due to the weather. Plan for a trail or 2 to be groomed off of each lift tomorrow. Then tomorrow night they’ll be able to hit the hill with both shifts and bring back your favorite trails. As things cool off I’m guessing a large swath of terrain will become undesirable for skiing and Ski Patrol will be raising ropes across the mountain.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for lows around the base in the mid-20s while winds ramp up overnight. Monday looks to bring us a cloudy day with temperatures again rising above freezing to highs of around 38 degrees at the base. Winds are in the moderate to strong category with speeds ranging from 20-40mph with gusts to 55mph on the summit. 45-55mph wind speeds are the grey area for lift operations at the loaf, so be prepared for the possibility of wind holds on the upper mountain tomorrow. This week looks sunny and temperate early week, with what appears to be a snow storm plotting to affect us Thursday into the weekend. The snow dances and sacrifices are working, keep it up!</p>
<p> Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
