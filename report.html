<p>Temps have moderated quite a bit after a cold and blustery start to the day today, and with ample sunshine and fairly light winds it has been a great day up the mountain. Morning run of the day today was Haulback, which opened yesterday for the first time this season. It's slated for a fresh groom again tonight, so I'll be pointing them in that direction again first thing tomorrow morning as well. </p>
<p>If you're heading our way tomorrow you can expect some warmer temps out there, with highs expected to reach the mid to upper 20s here at the base of the mountain. We'll see a lot more in the way of clouds tomorrow, with a chance for some light snow in the afternoon. It's looking quite a bit windier for tomorrow as well, especially at higher elevations, which could impact our upper mountain lifts. Be sure to check in right here tomorrow morning for all of the updates on lift operations. </p>
<p>Snowmakers are still in action this afternoon on West Mountain, Scoot, and Sidewinder, and they'll keep things going through the night tonight. Groomers have a full list again tonight, with fresh corduroy scheduled for most of the usual suspects, including Windrow over in the West Mountain area. We have 11 lifts scheduled to spin for you again tomorrow, including Timberline and King Pine, winds and weather permitting. SuperQuad and Skyline will open at 7:30am for our First Tracks pass holders as usual. </p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Ethan </p>
