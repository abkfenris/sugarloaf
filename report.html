<p><strong>UPDATE: Mixed precip and icing this morning are affecting all operations. Check below for live lift status. -8:34am</strong></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>With an assemblage of precipitations pelting the mountain last night, we’re just going to have to find something to hang on to and make our way to the hill to see what we’re going to get for today. With sleet and icing occurring overnight it is likely that SuperQuad and Whiffletree will experience a delay this morning.</p>
<p>The grooming team came in around midnight to get a limited arrangement of terrain for today. You may or may not find corduroy on some of the listed trails due to sleet/snow falling during the night. But the grooming team did hit Tote Road, Kings Landing, Sluice, Ramdown, Whiffletree area, Scoot, Windrow, and all the low terrain around the base. The crews also attended to Narrow Gauge and Competition Hill to try and swing at the Wakefield knuckleball nature threw at us overnight.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for continued awe at the spectacle of all the different precipitation types. However, the grooming team reported calm winds at 5:30 am. The forecast calls for winds switching to the NW with speeds ranging from 20-40mph, after yesterday’s debacle I’ll refrain from making an optimistic assumption about today’s lift eligibility. Temperatures remain right around freezing with highs reaching 37 degrees at the base. This bizarre weather wraps up as the day goes on. Saturday things look to clear up a bit to a nice day with highs in the upper 30s around the base. This week is looking quiet with cooler temperatures with the possibility of a significant storm late next week.</p>

<p>Safe Travels,</p>
