<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What a beautiful day to be on the mountain! Bright and sunny conditions after snow is always an enjoyable way to spend a day at Sugarloaf. With temperatures fluctuating over the next few days and winds picking up as cold fronts move in and out, you can bet your bottom that we will be working hard to get some good turns in for you! Every department is working in full force this week to help make the holidays run smoothly. Also as the holidays near this weekend, make sure to follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/sugarloafsnow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@SugarloafSnow</a> for quick and easy information about lifts on the fly. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The snow is piling up on Whiffletree, Skidder, Lombard X-Cut and Ramdown, which is exciting news as we creep further into the season. I can’t wait to be able to cruise down the east side as the sun rises and warms everyone’s little pink cheeks. The groomers are out in full force again, as usual, prepping the trails as best as they can and working through the night. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently temps are in the low-to-mid 20s by the base with winds of 20 to 25 mph, with a range of 14 to 20 degrees at the peak and winds of 30 to 50 mph leading into tomorrow. It seems like Tuesday will be a slightly warmer version of today, which makes for some fun runs with your best snow pals and another chance to eat some good breakfast at D’Ellies. Don’t forget to throw some silly faces at the Marketing Department as we catch you on the mountain first thing tomorrow morning...and the liftys (just for fun)!</p>
<p>Have a great night,</p>
<p>David</p>
