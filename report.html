<p>Good afternoon Snow Riders,</p>
<p>Well, you know what they say in New England. If you don’t like the forecast or the current weather just wait 10 minutes. With more wintery weather on the way this weekend, it’s a perfect time to let the FOMO take over and get up to the Loaf to work off those winter pounds riding a Bubblecuffer top to bottom.</p>
<p>Due to weather, only the 2<sup>nd</sup> shift will come in tonight so the grooming coverage will be a little less expansive tomorrow morning compared to today. It is likely safe to expect 1 trail of corduroy from each lift for tomorrow’s shred. As the warm weather and sun start to soften all snow types around the mountain Ski Patrol has been able to continue opening new trails daily, so make sure to check the report below to see if your favorite glade or natural snow trail is open.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for warm temps to persist into Friday where things begin to cool off during the day as our next weekend storm approaches. Winds ramp up slightly tomorrow from the NW at speeds ranging from 25-40mph, this should allow for most lifts to be able to operate tomorrow. Friday night winds switch around to the SE and precipitation begins in the form of snow early Saturday morning. Snow appears to hold on through Saturday night. The cold air looks to breakdown sometime Sunday morning where it’s looking like the second half of the storm will fall at a moister content level. Things can always change and snow gods appeased. We know what to do at this point.</p>
<p><em>“May the road rise up to meet you, may the wind be at your back, may the sun shine warm upon you face, and the rain fall soft upon your fields, and until we meet again. May god hold you in the palm of his hand.” –Irish Travel Blessing</em></p>
