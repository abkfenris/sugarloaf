<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The forecast for today hasn’t changed much, and things are looking to be on the warm and wet side. We will be operating with 6 lifts servicing 120 acres of open terrain, spread out over 22 trails. If you’re looking to take advantage of a relatively quiet Saturday here at the Loaf, today is your chance: separate yourself from the fair-weather Sugarloafers and come enjoy some soft turns with us!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last night things warmed up on the snowmakers, forcing them to shut down operations. They will remain offline today and tonight, planning to returning sometime Sunday when the temperatures begin to drop. The grooming team was out last night freshening up all of our terrain for today’s skiing delights; they were able to finish pushing out the whales of Hayburner, and arecurrently laying down corduroy for our enjoyment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The forecast today for mixed precipitation and temperatures in the mid-to-high 30s this Saturday with winds coming from the southwest at 15 to 25mph with gusts up to 60 mph at the summit. This undesirable weather will hold into tonight, and the system should start moving out early Sunday morning. The good news is, we won’t be dropping into the single digits immediately after the storm and you know our Mountain Ops crew will be hard at work getting us back to where we were last few days. Wishing you all a happy Saturday!</p>
<p>*Please be ready to roll with the punches today as we may experience delays or holds in lift operations due to weather.</p>
<p>Have fun today,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
