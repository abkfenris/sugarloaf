<p style="text-align: justify;">Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It's been a corker of a day out there, as my grandfather would say, as we finished off 2021 with very comfortable temps, minimal winds, and even some intermittent periods of sunshine throughout the day. It's shaping up to be a great night to ring in the New Year as well, so if you're sticking with us through the evening be sure to check out the full lineup of <a href="/events-calendar" title="Event Calendar">New Year's Eve festivities on our Event Calendar</a>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Groomers will have a busy schedule again tonight with a full list of trails slated for fresh corduroy, including Choker and Flume over in the King Pine Bowl. We have 10 lifts schedule to spin for you again tomorrow, winds and weather permitting. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The big question heading into the weekend is the weather, which looks like it will bring a little bit of everything our way over the next 48 hours. The good news is that the bulk of it doesn't arrive until tomorrow night, meaning we should be looking pretty good for Saturday. During the day tomorrow look for temps in the mid to upper 30s, with a chance for an isolated shower here or there throughout the day. Winds are looking pretty tame throughout the day tomorrow and shouldn't impact lift operations, but as always be sure to check in here for any updates tomorrow morning. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking further ahead, we'll see more light rain move in Saturday night into Sunday, with a substantial temperature drop and changeover to snow expected late in the day on Sunday. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Snowmaking will be offline until temps cool back down (likely Sunday afternoon), but will fire things back up as quickly as possible to keep expanding terrain in the New Year. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See you next year,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ethan </p>
