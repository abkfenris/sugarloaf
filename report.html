<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>This morning skiers and riders were tantalized with high lifts not opening on time because of high winds. However, the Skyline opened and Sugarloafers were able to enjoy beautiful corduroy and pockets of windblown powder from yesterday’s storm. With a couple of beautiful sunny cold days ahead leading us into Christmas we are about to see a significant increase in terrain for the Holiday break into New Year.</p>
<p>The snowmakers recently have been working hard trying to expand our terrain offerings further east. They have made tremendous progress on Whiffletree, Slasher, and Lombard X-Cut to get us access to the Whiffletree lift which is scheduled to open tomorrow. Currently, snowmaking is transitioning to start operations on Widowmaker, Choker, and Flume. Tonight the groomers are going to put the finishing touches on Whiffletree, Lombard X-Cut, and Slasher to be open for skiing and riding tomorrow. Of course they will also groom out all existing terrain for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Tonight’s weather sees temperatures dropping into the single digits and the base and below 0 at the summit. Winds will slightly diminish as the night progresses dropping summit speeds to the 30-50mph range. Tomorrow we are looking forward to a sunny Friday with calmer winds than today holding in the 30-50mph range at the summit. Looking ahead our next expected snow is due to arrive sometime Sunday with “substantial” precipitation possible. Deep cold returns on Monday and a continued active pattern into the next week.   </p>
<p>
<p> Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
