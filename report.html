<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’ve had, and will continue to experience, several waves of light precipitation: the first wave lasted through midday today, delivering festive flurries to our slopes, with the second front arriving tonight through tomorrow afternoon; we then expect to see a third wave arrive Friday evening, just in time to ring in the New Year!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking of festivities, I’ve got good news for those of you sticking around for après-ski with Treadstone in The Widowmaker, or joining us for the Climb for Cure this evening, we have a handful of rooms at the Sugarloaf Mountain Hotel that are eligible for <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/booklodging"><strong>one-night-stay bookings</strong></a>, so put on your dancing (or climbing!) shoes and join us for the second-to-last night of 2021 right here at the Loaf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Temperatures will drop tonight, climbing into the mid 20s at the summit tomorrow with mid 30s by the base. We’ll see more snow showers, with the possibility of it mixing, paired with winds up to 20 mph from the SW. We have 10 lifts scheduled to spin for you on Friday, including King Pine, which opened earlier this week and has provided skiers and riders with more space to spread out across the mountain—and more terrain to take turns on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Snowmaking operations will be offline until Sunday; once they get the guns going again, the team will continue working on Haulback until Tuesday, with additional efforts focusing on Sidewinder. Then, once Haulback is good to go, our snowmakers will start blasting West Mountain into a world of white, which is always an exciting sign that we're getting into the swing of things. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking ahead, we have some more unsettled weather headed our way beginning late Saturday and into Sunday. Forecasts suggest we’ll see a mixed bag of rain, snow, and everything in between, though you know what they say—“Don’t like the weather in Maine? Wait 5 minutes.” That being said, the details of this weekend’s weather are still coming together, so we'll keep an eye on it and provide any updates for you right here in the Mountain Report.</p>
<p>Enjoy your evenings,</p>
<p>Gabrielle</p>
