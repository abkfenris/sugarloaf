<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>I’m not going to lie – it was a bit of a sad sight out there today.  Those softies I was oh so looking forward to this morning were certainly mixed together with the hard and fast stuff.  Icey patches lurked here and there but what was open today was actually really fun.  The good news is that, with Timberline and King Pine lifts closed today, the snow on the sides of the mountain that didn’t get skied today will hopefully recover quite well as the temperature drops back down to a reasonable range.  To be blunt, Mother Nature wasn’t great on us last night but we’re doing all the right things in order to maintain as much of our natural snow as we possibly can.</p>
<p>Tonight, we should see temps heading back that way.  Our forecast shows 14-18 at the top and 25-29 at the base tonight with potential for it to get even colder.  Precipitation is expected on and off throughout the rest of the night so seeing those temperatures dip below freezing this afternoon bodes well for our chances of snowfall – we should see 1-2” of snow/sleet.  Grooming is going to repeat what they did last night just grooming essentially the trails in the middle portion of the mountain reachable via Superquad (not including Narrow Gauge) and some stuff off Skyline.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will see a slightly colder day but just as windy.  We are forecasted for 25-29 degrees and WNW 15-30 mph winds at base, 14-18 degrees and WNW/NW 35-55 mph winds at top.  King Pine and Timberline are ruled out so we’ll be going with the same 6 lifts that were scheduled today: Superquad, Skyline, Snubber, Skidway and DRC East will be rolling at 8:30am followed by Whiffletree at 9:00am.</p>
<p>I’ll be here in the morning to check it out, but I have faith another night of work by our mountain operations teams will do amazing things for us.  Spoons under pillows tonight everybody because something’s going to fall from the sky and it better be snow!</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
