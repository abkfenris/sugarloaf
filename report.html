<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Another Sunday fun day is here apon us. The weather may not be ideal, but the snow will be soft and the temperatures pleasant. So scramble the kids and the spouse and head to the lifts for the first chair because you just never know when those Sugarloaf winds will come a-blowin’.</p>
<p>The grooming team was busy on the hill last night buffing up all the trails from yesterday’s bluebird shred fest. Today you’ll find corduroy from West Mountain all the way to Haulback. The lift department just came in with an update from TOS. Winds were recorded at 20-30mph and Skyline is clear for operation.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for warming temps, light showers, and increasing winds. The showers will be light and inconsistent, so I’m optimistic that our snowpack will hold fast against this swing of Mother Nature’s mood. Temps will be in the upper 30s and winds increase during the day to speeds of 25-50mph with gusts to 70mph on the summit. Wouldn’t be surprised if these forecasted winds start to put some of our lifts on wind hold. However, the wind forecast has been wrong before. Keep your fingers crossed.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
