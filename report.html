<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Well, it feels like Reggae Fest was just yesterday and here we are staring down the barrel of closing day. It’s certainly looking to be an ideal day to celebrate a wonderful season of skiing at Sugarloaf with friends and family. So come on out and enjoy some sunshine and nostalgia here at the one and only King of Spring.</p>
<p>The grooming team tonight will hit the hill for a final round of operations grooming out mid-mountain terrain for tomorrow’s corn harvest. You’ll find trails like Kings Landing, Sluice, and Spillway all groomed and awaiting you first thing on this final Sunday fun day.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for clearing skies and cool temperatures. Tomorrow brings mostly sunny skies with temperatures reaching a high in the low 50s around the base. Since temperatures are cool overnight don’t expect soft buttered corn first thing, it is likely to take a few hours for things to soften up so take your time, stop for breakfast, watch that Sunday morning cartoon, and really charge yourself up to send the 2022 ski season out with a bang.</p>
<p>It’s been truly great riding the peaks and valleys with you all this winter. One thing that really hit home this year was the devotion and dedication Sugarloafers have to enjoy this incredible resource. Even on the worst of days here at the mountain, I was always emotionally lifted when I saw you all out there ripping up the loaf enjoying life in the mountains. Truly, thank you all, we’ll catch you right here at the Mountain Report in November.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
