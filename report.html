<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The big storm on Friday certainly set the stage for an unforgettable weekend of skiing and riding. Having two bluebird days in a row to explore 626 acres of beautiful mountain scenery combined with ideal conditions leaves us with so much to be thankful for. With another storm possibly hitting us early this week the stoke meter is pinned at max levels.</p>
<p>The mountain operations team is hitting the mountain tonight to further manicure our trails to deliver another day of high-quality ski conditions. The groomers have just a little more work to do to complete Lower White Nitro and prepare it for skiers and riders tomorrow. The park crew is still working to get the Dropline Park sculpted to open sometime this week. Snowmaking’s return is still to be determined.</p>
<p>The weather tonight sees temperatures remaining on par today as winds elevate this evening to the 35-50mph range on the upper mountain, around the base should be calm. Clouds move in overnight and remain present through mid-week. Tomorrow sees considerably warmer temps in the low 20s around the mountain. Winds are blustery in the 20-40mph range in the AM but die off throughout the day. Monday night Tuesday bring us a small disturbance with the possibility of dropping 3-6” of snow. There are also rumors floating around about another large system possible for next weekend.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
