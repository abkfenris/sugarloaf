<p>For a less than favorable forecast, today turned into a pretty nice spring day. Snow surfaces corned up nicely by early afternoon, and the scattered showers have – for the most part – held off with temperatures climbing to near-sixty degrees here at the base. I can’t say that I expect the same tomorrow, but only time will tell.</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s forecast for the next 48 hours calls for dropping temperatures with the possibility of a late-season snowstorm Thursday into Friday. So despite what the calendar will tell you, winter lives on here at Sugarloaf. Don’t go packing away your long johns just yet.</p>
<p>The grooming team will set out this evening to smooth surfaces on a handful of mid-mountain trails. And as is common this time of year, you should expect surfaces to be pretty firm in the mornings, before they loosen up later in the day as temps rise. These freeze thaw cycles make for great corn snow, but they also mean that you may find some trails roped off in the mornings until snow softens enough for Ski Patrol to open them up. During this time of year, the open trail count you see on this report is a reflection of the trails we expect to open at some point during the day, once surfaces soften.</p>
<p>We’ll see the same two late-season lifts – SuperQuad and Skyline – spinning at 8:30am, and for those of you planning your last ski days of the season, you can find our complete spring lift schedule <a href="/spring-operations-schedule">here.</a></p>
<p>Happy trails.<br/>Noelle</p>
