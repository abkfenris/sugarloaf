<p>Good morning Sugarloafers, </p>
<p>Well as they say, it's a good day to be a duck. And if you just so happen to be a duck who likes skiing, you are in for a splashtastic day. Forecasts are calling for light showers into the early afternoon hours before clearing out just in time for apres. So if you're up for some classic east coast slush slashing, go ahead and pack a change of dry clothes and come shred with us. </p>
<p>This pattern of warm and wet weather is expected to continue through Thursday, with the possibility of an unsettled storm front towards the end of the week. As always, we'll be keeping an eye on the forecasts and updating you accordingly right here in the daily report. </p>
<p>Last night, our team of groomers smoothed surfaces on 32 trails including Scoot, Tote Road, King Landing, Sluice, Rambdown, Whiffletree and Haulback. They also began leveling features in Dropline to set the stage for the East Coast Pond Skimming Championships, this Saturday, April 16th. </p>
<p>As the season winds down, we'll be <em><strong>scaling back lift operations</strong></em> with SuperQuad, Skyline, King Pine and DRC on the list to spin today. <a href="/spring-operations-schedule">Click here</a> for the complete schedule.</p>
<p>See you out there, <br/>Noelle</p>
