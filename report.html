<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Hopefully, all the sun and Guinness from yesterday won’t keep you from being up at first chair this morning because we are in for another wonderful day of snow riding. Things could get a little sticky out there today so make sure to check out The Downhill Supply Company over in the village for all your waxing needs.  <em> </em></p>
<p>Overnight temperatures remained well above freezing, so our snowcats did very little and preserving our precious snowpack. You will find corduroy on Tote Road, Sluice, and Ramdown. They did also hit a bunch of terrain on the lower mountain like Boardwalk, Lower Winters, and The Landing.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for partly cloudy skies, temperatures in the 40s with winds ramping up to the 30-40mph range from the NW. As the day goes on more clouds will develop ahead of an event that will start precipitating things on us possibly as early as this afternoon. Temperatures start to fall as we head into the evening hours where we will see temperatures down to around the freezing mark overnight. Saturday looks to be a little bit of a mess with <a href="https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=forest+gump+rain+in+vietnam&amp;view=detail&amp;mid=CB52185E37E3FE16DAA1CB52185E37E3FE16DAA1&amp;FORM=VIRE">every type of precipitation there is</a>. A little bit of stinging precip, big old fat precip, precip that flew in sideways, and sometimes precip that seemed to come straight up from underneath. Winds switch around to the SSE to speeds ranging from 25-40mph, which should allow for most lifts to operate tomorrow. </p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
