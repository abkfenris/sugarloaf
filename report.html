<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another Monday has come and gone, and with it, another day of good skiing follows! Things looked a little dusty this morning as we came into work, and the flurries seem to be continuing to fall into the early morning hours, so wrap up those breakfast sandwiches and grab your best friend for first chair and light snow showers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The grooming department is scheduled to have everything on their list checked off this morning, which means that they were up all night hard at work. First tracks are going to be nice and clean this morning, especially with that little extra snow fall we are getting. I saw the snowmakers daunting their snow-crusted gear as I came in, and gave them a hoot and a holler and a big "thank you" for the great job they are doing this year. Even though things were a bit slow in the beginning of the season, they are now in full "go go go" mode! And don’t forget the hard work the rest of the departments are putting in to make this year a fun and memorable experience on the mountain. We have a lot of great events happening this week for vacation fun, and we are excited to see everyone’s smiling happy faces!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today’s weather seems a little warm even though the clouds will be out most of the day and the sun will be hiding. At the base we have temps of 28F with a high of 32F today around noon. The winds are slightly higher today than yesterday, with an average of 10 mph at the base. Temps at the summit are in the low 20s, with a high of 23, and it is slightly gustier up top with winds between 20-30mph.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See you on the slopes,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">David</p>
