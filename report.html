<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Clouds and winds moved in quickly this morning allowing things to warm up. Again I have to commemorate the grooming department for consistently maintaining a high standard. They are indeed are our most valuable players when it comes to responding to dramatic weather shifts.</p>
<p>The snowmaking team continued operations on the hill today. As temperatures rise they will retreat to the high terrain and continue blasting Nitro and Gondi Ext. until Mother Nature closes the window of opportunity. Once again the Terrain Park crew is set to have Dropline open for tomorrow, so bring you big boy britches and be ready to send.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for temps continuing to rise as our next system moves into the area. Winds elevate even higher overnight where gusts will reach upwards of 70mph on the summit. Tomorrow rain moves into the area with temps in the mid-to-upper 30’s. Winds remain strong from the SW at speeds around 20mph at the base and 45-65mph at the summit. Rain and wind continue into Thursday night with rainfall totals around ¾ of an inch into Friday. As the system departs it drags in cold air possibly allowing for some snow on the back end before temperatures drop to normal levels for Friday in the low 20’s.</p>
<p>The next few days are going to be sloppy with rain, wind holds, and terrain closures. So if you’re committed to visiting us between now and the weekend please come with an open mind and alternate plans to skiing on the hill.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
