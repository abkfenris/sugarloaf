<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>We continue to battle unfavorable elements and conditions laid before us by Mother Nature. It never ceases to amaze me the diverse weather we experience at Sugarloaf regularly, and we always come out on the other side with something to go skiing on. Around lunch time conditions softened enough to allow snow riding from the SuperQuad and Skyline. Skiers and riders were treated to nice corn conditions as the sun even started to poke through after lunch.</p>
<p>The grooming team will hit the mountain again tonight to do everything they can to maintain a high standard of surface quality. Ski Patrol today has been forced in closing a significant amount of terrain due to everything literally being coated with ice overnight. It is unknown how these surfaces will develop over the next 24 hours. So let us just keep our fingers crossed that either today or tomorrow will warm enough to melt away such an irritating surface.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for temperatures to fall below freezing down to the base tonight. Winds remain moderate overnight before calming slightly into tomorrow. Saturday looks to bring a mix of sun and clouds with temperatures reaching a high of around 40 degrees at the base. Sunday brings another small chance of mixed precip along with temps in the upper 30s with calm to moderate winds. The rest of the week looks cooler and dry before another large system looks to affect us later in the week. Keep your fingers crossed, snow dances vigorous, and sacrifices worthy.</p>
<p>Good Day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
