<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>An inch a day will keep the boilerplate away! Another inch has fallen overnight and the snowfall continues at Sugarloaf. Yesterday’s tasty conditions will only be further seasoned with more scrumptious flavors that will have all snow riders watering from the mouth.</p>
<p>The grooming department hit the hill last night and groomed a fair bit of terrain. The groomers left everything east of Ramdown alone due to King Pine remaining offline today due to maintenance.  Make sure to check the list below for a detailed grooming report. As soft surfaces start to be widespread across the mountain Patrol will continue to poke around and start to open more terrain.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for cloudy skies and temps reaching a high of around 20 degrees at the base. Winds are forecasted in the 30-50mph range on the upper mountain. Temps drop again tonight where the base of Sugarloaf will see lows around 0. Friday and Saturday look to bring brisk temperatures and sunny skies with moderate winds. Looking further down the road there is a complicated system lining up to affect starting Sunday and cruising into the first part of the week.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
