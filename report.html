<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Today is looking as if it wants to make up for the last 2 days with bright sun, warm temperatures, and a spring vibe that you can only find here at Sugarloaf. With our sustained slopes and long dreamy top to bottom runs it’s very easy to get into that flow state and just keep calm and ski.</p>
<p>The groomer last night hit Tote Road and Sluice overnight and a few trails on the lower mountain. Considering nobody skied up top yesterday you’ll still find smooth surfaces all around the mid-mountain area. With temperatures warming into the low 50’s today we are set up for some perfect corn in a few hours.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for mostly sunny skies and increasing clouds. Warm temps prevail as SW winds kick up this afternoon as a weak disturbance approaches us to the 35-55mph range. Tonight calls for a chance of showers with elevated winds, while Friday looks roughly the same.</p>
<p>Stay Tuned,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
