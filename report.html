<p><strong>Stomping Grounds will be closed today due to a Slopestyle Competition.</strong></p>
<p>Good morning snow riders,</p>
<p>Today we are looking at skiing and riding on 83 trails, serviced by 10 lifts, over 442 acres of terrain. With a brief reprieve from arctic temps today, it is certainly a lovely day to get out and enjoy the Mountains. Don’t let being sore from yesterday’s greatness hold you back this morning. Brew the coffee, steep the tea, and scramble the eggs because we got one day of freedom left before we must go about our business in the coming week.</p>
<p>Last night the snowmaking team maintained operations on Gondi-Line. This morning they are going to be reducing production on Lower Gondi Line and transitioning that water to Upper Timberline. This has me excited because there is nothing like a late afternoon run with dynamic lighting and having the beauty of Crocker Mountain in your periphery while gently cruising along. The grooming team had another full docket last night and groomed all of our snowmaking trails from West Mountain to Haulback, with the exception of Choker. The park crew continues to refine existing terrain parks, and speculate and plan out the features for the final 2 parks yet to open at Sugarloaf, Drop-Line, and Sidewinder. Today you will be able to see our snowcats working on Sidewinder as you ride the SuperQuad.</p>
<p>The weather today proves pleasant with high temps around the base in the low-to-mid 20s. Expect it to be a little colder up top. Clouds will mostly prevail today with a flurry or 2 to give that wonderful snow globe vibe. Winds remain on the moderate side in the range of 15-30mph. I doubt we’ll see any wind holds today. Tonight temps drop back below zero ahead of another cold start to the week. Looking down the trail our next shot at substantial snow appears to be next weekend. So keep your fingers crossed and keep bustin’ out your best snow god appeasement moves because the thought of another foot on top of what we have now is quite blissful.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
