<p>Good morning grateful shredders,<br/>Thank Jerry it’s Friday, we’ve made it through another week of wild New England weather, but it’s <em>the same story the crow told me,</em> and we're bouncing back <em>with laughin in our eyes and dancin in our feet. </em>The odyssey of Sugarloaf 2022 continues today with fresh snow, calm winds, and the onset of the <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/events-calendar/fire-on-the-mountain">Fire on the Mountain</a>. So get truckin, beat it on down the line, and make it up here for this weekend, because something’s surely shaking on Sugarloaf Street.</p>
<p>Snowmakers last night operated on Lower Tote Road, Candyside, and around the base area. Early this morning they’ll switch off Lower Tote and move to the summit which has gotten a little beaten up from last week’s weather. The grooming department has been hard at it since the lifts closed yesterday covering as much terrain as they can. It is likely we will see a delayed opening on the eastern side of the mountain today. The lift department is on the hill doing their everyday safety checks and reporting winds 15-20mph at the TOS which is a good sign for full lift operations today.</p>
<p>Today’s <em>weather report suite</em> calls for temps in the low teens, W winds 15-25mph, and 4-7 inches of snow possible. The snow begins light early AM and grows in steadiness about when the lifts open. The bulk of the snow is projected to fall during lift operations today producing better and better ski conditions as the day goes on. <em>So long distance runner what are you standing there for?</em> It’s time to <em>run to the roses </em>and <em>let the good times roll.</em></p>
<p>Surfs up,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
