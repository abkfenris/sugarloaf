<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Day after day this week, we've been waking up to the best conditions of the season, and today was no exception. With partly sunny skies, snow flurries and comfortable temperatures, it was a real beauty out there today. Temperatures will take a bit of a nosedive this evening, so if you're planning to hit the hill tomorrow, be sure to bundle up. </p>
<p>Tonight the grooming department plans to hit the hill and cover all of our trails with fresh buttery corduroy. Snowmaking remains offline until tomorrow when they’ll fire up equipment on Upper Timberline and Gondola Line, from the summit to Lombard. Tomorrow we have 8 lifts scheduled to service 84 trails, welcoming back King Pine and Timberline in the list.</p>
<p>Tonight we are plunged into another bout of cold weather where the summit will see temperatures as low as -20. Tomorrow winds calm down a bit to the 20-35mph range and things warm up slightly to hang around zero degrees. Looking ahead to the weekend it seems were bound for continued cold weather. Sunday things moderate a bit we’re looking at seeing temperatures back into the teens and ’20s. In general, winter continues to hold its arctic grip on the mountain, which is best for preserving this soft enjoyable snowpack we have been enjoying the last few days. So don’t let the cold discourage you from enjoying the classic trails of Sugarloaf.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
