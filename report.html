<p><strong>UPDATE: Winds are affecting lift operations currently.  Make sure to check below for live lift updates. -10:13am</strong></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The snow riding continues here at Sugarloaf with 376 acres of terrain over 73 trails. Today we have 4 lifts scheduled to run including SuperQuad, Skyline, Double Runner, and King Pine. With rain overnight and continued showers through the day, you can expect some slushy spring snow surfaces out there.</p>
<p>The grooming team was able to hit Tote Road and Boardwalk this morning, along with some work in areas where there is significant runoff occurring on the trails.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for continued showers totaling around a ¼ inch of rain. Winds remain calmish from the southeast with speeds around 20 mph. Temperatures today remain pleasant where the base will see highs in the mid-40s, while the summit will see colder temperatures in the mid-30s. Rain continues tonight with another ¼ inch of rain possible. Tomorrow clouds move out as we settle in for a mostly sunny day with highs reaching the mid-50s during the day.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
