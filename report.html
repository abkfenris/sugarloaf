<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>And what a lovely afternoon of snow riding that is going on right now. The temperatures are comfortable, the winds benign, and the sun is shining. What better way than to enjoy a day of leisure slip-sliding the slopes of Sugarloaf with friends and family on a brilliant Saturday afternoon. Days like today are definitely nice to remember on a hot and sticky day in late July.</p>
<p>The grooming team is set up for greatness tonight with a full roster of operators scheduled to hit the hill at 4:30 this evening. They plan to cover most of our terrain with another world-class snow surface for everyone’s enjoyment tomorrow morning. The snowmaking crew is currently on an indefinite hiatus from operations until Mother Nature forces their return. With Reggae Fest only a month away they just might have done their last gun run already.</p>
<p>The weather tonight brings the onset of a storm system that I’ve been trying to ignore all week. However, it does appear to be improving in the way of the type of precipitation. Things start cold tonight as light snow showers move in early Sunday morning. Sometime during the AM hours snow showers will turn to sleet, sleet will turn to showers. Temps Sunday will reach a high of around 42 at the base, and winds will be strong in the 25-50mph range with gusts to 70mph on the summit. Then finally showers will turn back into sleet/snow showers as things wind down Sunday night. Looking to Monday things cool off a bit with a quick break in precipitation in the morning before a second system moves in for Monday afternoon into Tuesday morning. Currently, it is looking like most of this will fall as snow but totals or precip type aren’t obvious at this point, so we’ll just have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
