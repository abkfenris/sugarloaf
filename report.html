<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> Everybody’s working for the weekend and we have made it. So come and find your new or old romance here at Sugarloaf. With our Mountain Ops team in animal mode our terrain offerings have been expanding as fast as they possibly can. Even though our forecast for the weekend is lamentable. It might just be the perfect one to treat yourself and a loved one to a nice cozy weekend getaway here in our corner of the western Maine Mountains.</p>
<p>Tonight the grooming team will be heading out to re-butter all of our existing terrain, spread out on 116 acres and 21 trails. We are scheduled to have 4 lifts running tomorrow with SuperQuad, Skyline, Timberline, Double Runner, and Skidway. Offering top to bottom skiing to some of the most sustainable fall line skiing around. The snowmaking team is going to hang on to operations as long as possible until our next storm system moves in, scheduled to arrive Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Weather tonight will remain consistent with what we are currently seeing in our region. Things start to change early morning as our next precipitation event starts to affect us. Things will start off as sleet and snow showers, then gradually start to turn over to freezing rain as the day goes on. Good news is the skiing will be soft, and the cocoa is always hot. If I do know one thing about Sugarloafers, it is that we are tolerant, and sometimes even embracing to the knuckleballs of Mother Nature, and no matter what kind of deplorable weather she can send our way, there is ALWAYS going to be a whole squadron of Sugarloafers singing in the showers, stomping in the slush, and doing what they  love.</p>
<p>*Due to tomarrows forecast, it is possible we will experience holds on lift operations due to weather. Make sure to check <a href="twitter.com/sugarloafsnow">@sugarloafsnow  </a>on Twitter for the most up date information.</p>
<p>We’ll catch you right here in the morning,</p>
<p> Chris</p>
