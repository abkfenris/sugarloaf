<p>Well, today turned out to be a nice lazy day – which, if you are Myles Silverman, is precisely what the doctor ordered after shattering the <a href="/press-releases/silverman-world-record">Guinness World Record for greatest vertical distance snowboarded in 12 hours</a> yesterday with a staggering 56 laps on Narrow Gauge and just shy of 100K vert. And for the rest of us, it was a good opportunity to put a dent in the Netflix watchlist.</p>
<p>We picked up a few inches of fresh snow at the base before things switched over to rain, but word on the hill is that precipitation at higher elevations has remained snow throughout the day. Only time will tell what the total accumulation is, so be sure to check back in the morning for another update.</p>
<p>As this storm system moves out, we’ll see diminishing winds and clearing skies for tomorrow. Temperatures will remain on the cooler side of seasonal throughout the with highs in the mid-to-high twenties expected at the top of the mountain and low-forties at the base. But despite the quick visit from Old Man Winter, more spring-like weather is predicted to return for the end of the week.</p>
<p>Our groomers will set out this evening with a light, late-season list of trails to smooth out overnight, including Sluice, Hayburner, Kings Landing, and Tote Road. Surfaces will likely stiffen up by morning and Ski Patrol may temporarily limit skiing and riding to groomed terrain until things soften up. We’ll be sure to keep you posted with the latest right here.</p>
<p>Our late-season lift schedule includes the same three lifts for tomorrow; DRC East, SuperQuad and Skyline. And if you're looking ahead through the final two weeks of the season here, you can see our <a href="/spring-operations-schedule">anticipated spring lift operations schedule right here</a>.</p>
<p>And now back to your regularly scheduled Netflix binge. <br/>Noelle</p>
