<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Update</strong>: The SuperQuad and Skyline are open!  Timberline will  remain on wind hold-1:44pm</p>
<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Today is one of those days that really allows us to have some solid appreciation for the days past and the warm lodge. We might be longing for sun up to sun down skiing but some days are best stretching and getting back to the basics. So don’t forget to practice those turns and work those edges, as we get ready to end the day with the sun setting and the SuperQuad running!  </p>
<p>The weather temperatures are still helping our snowmakers bounce along the mountainside tonight and into tomorrow. With the trail updates being the same: Whiffletree, Lombard X-cut Skidder and spillway x-cut. And we hear talk of the snowmakers maybe making their way over to Cruiser tomorrow. But that’s for another day. Another day another dollar. As the groomers fill their mugs with coffee and get ready for the end of Tuesday, I can only imagine how satisfying it is to make such clean beautiful corduroy.</p>
<p>Weather updates heading into tomorrow look great. It’s our favorite type of clouds rolling in through the night to drop that lovely white snow on us again and the winds are slowing down from here into tomorrow morning. It seems the temperatures will hold for the night with 19-24F around the base and 14-19F at the summit. We are happy to wrap up Tuesday skiing with our friends and family here at Sugarloaf and hope you have an amazing night around a warm fire or with a good movie!</p>
<p>Have a good night and sleep well,</p>
<p>David</p>
