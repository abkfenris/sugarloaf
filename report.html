<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Hope everyone is enjoying another day at the King of Spring. Warm temps, calm winds, and 350 acres of terrain are making us really live up to the title. With our major trails still skiing wall to wall and our Carrabassett Cream holding strong from Widowmaker to Bridal Chain you can bet we are still rocking winter vibes in spring weather here at Sugarloaf.</p>
<p>The grooming team tonight plans to hit the hill a little harder than last night buffing a variety of mid-mountain terrain for tomorrow’s corn harvest. With our <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/spring-operations-schedule">late-season lift schedule</a> in effect, you can plan on 3 lifts operating tomorrow including Double Runner, SuperQuad, and Skyline.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for increasing clouds and a chance of rain showers during the overnight hours. Temperatures drop to around freezing at the summit, while the base stays in the upper 30s. Tomorrow brings a chance of isolated rain/snow showers with slightly cooler temps with highs in the mid-40s around the base. Winds will range from 30-40mph with gusts up to 60mph on the summit. Heading this weekend we are currently looking at clear and sunny days with temperatures in the mid-to-upper 40’s.</p>
<p>Stay Tuned,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
