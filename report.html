<p><b>SuperQuad, Skyline, Whiffletree, and King Pine are closed for the day due to conditions. -10:32am</b></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Come people be a part of this whole, with this Burning Reggae, bumpin’ up and down and all around the trails on this mountain kingdom. Although the water falls from the sky, it’s nothing that we can’t be prepared for. Take your time, bring extra dry layers, contractor bag ponchos, and all your favorite Reggae Fest goodies and soon the weather just won’t matter.</p>
<p>The grooming team is currently buffing out a selection of trails for skiing and riding today. The SuperQuad will sport the most groomers today with Tote Road, Kings Landing, and Hayburner. While over to Skyline it appears we’ll have Sluice and Ramdown. The Lift Maintenance crew is about doing their routine checks and a report came in from Skyline with winds 10-15mph and it’s currently clear for operations.</p>
<p>The weather today called for a wintery mix, but it is just raining right now, and it’s looking to hold like this throughout the day. We’ll see a high temperature of around 40 at the base today while the summit stays right around the freezing mark. Winds are moderate to strong coming from the southeast at speeds 30-40mph with gusts to 55mph expected on the summit. Showers start to taper off tonight while the winds subside. Saturday looks to bring a cloudy dryish morning, with heavier showers taking aim at the mountain for the late afternoon. Sunday brings reduced chances of showers with another cloudy day.   </p>
<p>Lively Up Yourself,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
