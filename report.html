<p> Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> Another beautiful sunny day awaits all who come to visit us at Sugarloaf today. Now with trails opening on the east side, it is definitely the spot to go first thing to catch some sun rays before it dips behind the mountain for the day.</p>
<p>The snowmakers last night enjoyed another glorious run of ideal conditions, with temperatures around zero and relatively calm winds. They operated on Upper Tote, Haulback, Stomping Grounds, and also ran some guns for touch-up on Cruiser and Whiffletree. The grooming team went out and tackled all of our open terrain like Teddy Bruschi, with the exception of Windrow and Skidder which were left alone.</p>
<p>Today skiers and riders will enjoy sunny skies, moderate winds, and warming temperatures.  This morning expects things to be downright nippy. However, as the day goes on will expect highs mid-mountain to be in the upper teens. Winds reported this morning top of Skyline in the 25-30mph range with gusts to the 40’s Wednesday morning a storm system moves in bringing mostly scattered snow showers throughout the day and some heavier snowfall expected overnight with the possibility of dropping an inch or 2 of snow by Thursday morning. Looking down the road after Wednesday it appears the deeper cold continues with the possibility of some heavier snow from Friday into Saturday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris<br/><br/></p>
