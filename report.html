<p style="text-align: justify;">Happy Monday, Sugarloaf skiers and riders! First day of the workweek down, four to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Precipitation began in the early hours of the morning, first falling as snow before beginning to mix; it's forecasted that we should see this system switch entirely to rain by the afternoon. I'd classify the current weather on-hill as BYOS (Bring Your Own Squeegee). Temperatures have entered a trend of moderation paired with elevated winds from the south-southwest. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those heading to the hill tomorrow, we expect to have mostly cloudy skies with temperatures in the teens at the summit and 20s by the base. Winds should subside, though there still may be blustery conditions at higher elevation terrain. We expect to have the same 18 trails as today serviced by our 3 scheduled lifts, all opening at 8:30am. <em><strong>Please note that uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>In operational news, our groomers will be chasing the temperatures throughout the early hours of Tuesday, with plans to deliver TLC to all open trails west of Gauge. If they have time, they'll take the snowcats over to Sluice. As for our </span><span>tireless team of Sugarloaf snowmakers, they have continued forward on the march of expansion, getting the guns going on The Birches, Hayburner, and Spillway overnight; </span>they have since shut down to weather this storm. Following this front, which will hold through tonight, we expect temperatures to cool down into prime-time snowmaking range. Their plan going forward is to finish up work on The Birches while starting up operations on Hayburner and Windrow. We should see their systems back online in the AM.</p>
<p>Singing off 'till tomorrow,</p>
<p>Gabrielle</p>
