<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> The Snow be flyin’, the lifts are turning, and patrol is padding up the Skyline lift Towers. What a treat we have today for some mid-week soul sliding. There is nothing quite like a calm and quiet day for some quality Quad laps. With about an inch already on the ground with another inch or two on the way, things are looking to be prime for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The snowmaker team had to bring things off line for a short period this morning, but are currently working on getting the guns fired back up on Windrow, Hayburner, and the Birches. Tonight while we are all enjoying an après session, treating ourselves to a nice dinner, or cuddling up with our favorite fur ball, our mountain operation team faces the unforgiving environment that Sugarloaf is at night. The groomers will head out and canvas all of our trails with beautiful Zen gardens of corduroy</p>
<p>Tonight weather is calling for the snow showers to persist and wrapping up around 8pm. Wind will be calm around 10mph with temps in the low teens. Making for an ideal night of snowmaking. Tomorrow expect a chance of snow showers in the morning then partly sunny skies, with day time highs in the low twenties, winds are reasonable in the 20mph range. Looking forward to seeing ya’ll on the hill tomorrow.</p>
<p><span>I also have some bad news and good news for you, boys and girls – this weekend’s wet weather is putting a damper on the outdoor festivities (literally), so we’ve made the decision to postpone the Holiday Tree Lighting Festival &amp; Fireworks to the following weekend, Saturday, December 18</span><sup>th</sup><span>.</span></p>
<p>Catch you here first thing tomarrow,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
