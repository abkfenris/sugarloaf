<p style="text-align: justify;">Good Tuesday morning, Sugarloaf skiers and riders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Light snow showers began late last night and continued to fall this morning, leaving a nice dusting of fresh flurries for those getting out on the hill for first tracks. We expect the weather to be enjoyable today, with temperatures ranging from 23-27 at the base and 13-17 at the top, with winds blowing SS 12-18 mph at lower elevation terrain and SSW 20-35 at summit; skies should be mostly cloudy today, with overall accumulation estimated to be less than one inch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of terrain, we have our 82 trails (436 acres) primed for you to shred via our 6 scheduled lifts: DRC B, Skidway, Skyline, Snubber, and the SuperQuad will open at 8:30am, followed by Timberline and Whiffletree going online at 9:00am, all of which will provide access to an assortment of trails with a beautiful lick of fresh natural snow. Open parks for today include Boardwalk (small), Spurline (medium), Stomping Grounds (medium/large), and Upper Tote (small/medium).  The terrain parks crew has been grinding to refine and maintain our existing parks<span>–</span>my personal favorite being the booters in Stomping Grounds<span>–</span>and continue to plan features for the final 2 parks to open this season, Drop Line and Sidewinder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last night, our tireless team of groomers hit their usual weekday roster including Hayburner, King’s Landing, Ramdown, Slasher, Tote Road, and Whiffletree top-to-bottom. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The forecast for tomorrow shows temperatures dropping back down to single digits, but it should be accompanied by some partial sunlight.  Looking further forward, we are all trying to not get too excited about the potential snowstorm this upcoming weekend.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
