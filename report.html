<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Today the mountain is handling the inclement weather fairly well. On Piste terrains skied fast and edgeable while off the piste ranged from soft to firm to peanut butter. With a bunch of snow predicted to come in right side up tonight and tomorrow our beloved Sugarloaf is ready to show her true colors. So come get snowed in here with us at Sugarloaf.</p>
<p>The grooming team tonight will hit a limited arrangement of trails to freshen up overnight. I did confer with Ski Patrol today and they do indeed have terrain east of Ripsaw on their radar depending on tonight’s snowfall. The lift department is planning for full operations tomorrow with 9 lifts scheduled to turn. Winds tomorrow are forecasted in the 15-25mph on the upper mountain which should allow all 9 lifts to get you to your favorite powder stashes on the mountain.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for falling temperatures along with ample snow. Currently, we are forecasted in the 12-18” range. The snow is going to start heavy and wet, then end with light and fluffy powder. We refer to this as a right-side-up storm. It creates ideal snow riding conditions that can be described as bottomless because you’re riding the wet and heavy on the bottom instead of the firm old surface. While there is light and fluffy on top that gives you that addictive flying sensation that powder skiers crave. Temps tomorrow are comfortable in the upper teens and low twenties. Winds are surprisingly calm. To break down the snow totals tonight we are expecting 4-6 inches with an additional 6-10” to fall during the day tomorrow. We’ll have overnight snow totals for you first thing tomorrow so make sure to check in with us here at the Mountain Report.    </p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
