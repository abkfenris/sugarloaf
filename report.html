<p><strong>UPDATE: Whiffletree and Skyline on wind hold. 10:21am</strong></p>
<p>Buenos Dias Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> It sure was nice this morning to not be assaulted by the air. This however is bittersweet. Today we have a nice comfortable day on our hands with warm temps and moderate winds out of the south. A plethora of groomed terrain awaits all who make the journey early.</p>
<p>Last night our snowmakers had to shut down operations due to unfavorable winds and temperatures. They plan on being able to return sometime Sunday when the whole state is plunged into an epic cold that will make the last two days seem like a beach day in the Keys. The grooming team went out and about the mountain last night grooming all of our open terrains. Overall a pretty quiet night within Mountain Operations, which is much needed after a big push to the holiday season.</p>
<p>Today, the weather calls for temps in the upper 20’s and winds from the south blowing around 30mph with gusts to 60 on the summit. Be ready for the wind blowing directly up your britches as you ride the lifts today. Light Snow showers move onto the scene this afternoon. Things pick up slightly this afternoon around the time of lift closing where the warmer temperatures threaten a mix of precipitation, but in the end, it’s looking like snow will prevail with the possibility of an inch or two being on the ground by Thursday morning. Hoping to know more this afternoon about a more energized storm system that appears to affect us Friday into Saturday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keep your fingers crossed,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chris</p>
