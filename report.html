<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Today is delivering the goods with running lifts, continued snowfall, and a whole heap of new terrain becoming available.  With sunny weather on tap for this weekend and the snow still coming down. This weekend is looking to offer prime time conditions and memorable moments here in Carrabassett Valley.</p>
<p>The grooming department will hit the hill tonight and bust up all the bumps everyone made today and turn it into creamy corduroy. They also have the task of pushing out Sluice Headwall and Wedge. Make sure to check below for our detailed grooming and open terrain report before you hit the hill tomorrow.</p>
<p>The snow continues to fall and is supposed to wrap up sometime tonight with another couple of inches possible during the overnight hours. Temperatures drop to the single digits and winds remain calm around 15mph. Tomorrow, clouds give way to partial sun and slightly elevated winds. Highs at the base will be around 13 degrees while the summit will be lucky to reach zero. The winds will reach about 40mph on the upper mountain. Saturday night temperatures drop below zero and things warm on Sunday to the teens during the day. Bring your poofy and grab that new neck buff at Downhill Supply and you’ll be ready to enjoy a weekend in the Maine mountains.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
