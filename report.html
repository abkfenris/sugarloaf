<p>Good morning, Sugarloaf skiers and riders.</p>
<p>After starting the week with a spell of wet weather that caused temperatures to moderate, cold is making a comeback here in Carrabassett; for those heading to the hill today, dress for teens at the summit with mid-20s by at the base. Snow is also back on the agenda, since we scored some unexpected showers this AM with  a weak shortwave bringing light snow showers through tomorrow evening, possibly into Thursday. While neither system is forecasted to provide substantial opportunities for accumulation, every bit counts, and as I like to say, it's never too soon to start snow dancing to see if we can swing these fronts in our favor! </p>
<p>Skidway, Skyline, and the SuperQuad are all scheduled to start spinning today at 8:30am. We'll be taking Tuesday turns on our 18 open trails under sunny bluebird skies with elevated winds from the west-northwest, which may impact lift operations. In addition, please be note that Narrow Gauge is closed for race training. As always, you can count on us to keep the Mountain Report up-to-date on the latest in lifts and trails, as well as our Snow Reporting Twitter,<a href="https://twitter.com/SugarloafSnow" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> @SugarloafSnow.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>In operational news, our groomers took to the hill in the wee hours to deliver a little TLC to all open trails west of Gauge. As for our </span><span>tireless team of Sugarloaf snowmakers, they have continued forward on the march of expansion, getting the guns back online this AM. </span>Their plan going forward is to finish up work on The Birches and Hayburner while starting up operations on Windrow.</p>
<p>See you on the slopes,</p>
<p>Gabrielle</p>
