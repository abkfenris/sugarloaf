<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Not a bad kick off to vacation week today.  Snowmaking efforts certainly helped bounce back from this stretch of warm weather – a great day to be riding groomers, especially once the sun had some time to shine.  It’s always a good day being on the hill and I’m genuinely impressed by the mountain operations teams once again.</p>
<p>Looks like snowmaking operations will be shut down through the rest of this week due to warmer temperatures in the forecast.  Grooming tonight will be getting as much of the mountain re-striped as they possibly can, potentially leaving Hayburner out of play for another day in order to get Kings Landing back to where we want it.  Lifts tomorrow will be consistent with today with Superquad, Skyline, Double Runner East, Double Runner West, Sawduster, Skidway, Snubber and West Mountain at 8:30am, Whiffletree, King Pine and Timberline at 9:00am.</p>
<p>Some Terrain Park development that I failed to mention this morning – Dropline is open!  Several awesome new features are open and ready to be hit.  The money-booter was shut down today for safety reasons (it’s huge!) but park crew is confident that they’ll have it sculpted safely and back in action tomorrow.</p>
<p>Tonight, temperatures will more or less stay the same with a chance for some AM flurries.  Tomorrow we’re looking at another warm and windy day.  The forecast is showing temps of 23-27 at base, 25-29 at top with winds of 10-16 N/ESE at base and 25-40 W at top.  Sky cover will be cloudy with more chances for flurries throughout the morning that will likely give way to a mix of wintry precipitation in the afternoon.  We can reasonably expect snow and ice accumulation of 1-3 inches so definitely bring whatever gear you know can keep you dry.  A warm and wet day doesn’t sound too bad to me.</p>
<p>Check in again tomorrow morning for more information and updates.</p>
<p>Best.</p>
