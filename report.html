<p>Spring skiing doesnâ€™t get much better than this, folks. Thanks to non-stop sunshine and temperatures steadily rising throughout the day, snow surfaces have corned up nicely, making for some all-time harvesting out on the hill. And if you were thinking that we still have a lot of snow out there, just wait until tomorrow â€“ forecasts are calling for up to a half foot of accumulation throughout the day. We've seen these late-season storms overperform at higher elevations in the past, so I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if snow totals are more than double that at the top of the SuperQuad. Fingers crossed for good measure, but be sure to check back here tomorrow morning for all the details.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ll see seasonally cooler temperatures tomorrow with highs in the mid-thirties at the summit, and low-forties at the base. Winds are expected to pick up with the incoming storm front, but should remain mild enough as to not impact lift operations.</p>
<p>The same three lifts, SuperQuad, Skyline, and Double Runner East are all scheduled to spin again tomorrow at 8:30am. As always, be sure to check out the lift report below for current lift status, and if you're looking ahead through the final two weeks of the season here, you can see our <a href="/spring-operations-schedule">anticipated spring lift operations schedule right here</a>.</p>
<p>And for those of you wondering about Sugarloafer Myles Silvermanâ€™s world record attempt for most vertical feet snowboarded in 12 hours, Iâ€™m happy to report that at the time of this update, he has surpassed the current Guinness World Record (62,335 ft) with another four left to shred. Suffice to say we have another record-setting snowboarder in our midst.</p>
