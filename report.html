<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>As always brave and hearty souls faced cold temps, bone-chilling winds, and lift holds and made their way to the mountain determined to get their fill of snow sliding therapy. I’m always impressed by the positive spirit of Sugarloafers to turn out despite disappointing weather forecasts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our snowmakers today enjoyed ideal conditions for manufacturing snow. They continued operations on Sidewinder, Comp Hill and will remain there for the night. The grooming crew is slated to again tackle the mountain and groom out as much terrain as possible for tomorrow’s sunny day skiing delights. Make sure to check the grooming report below in the morning.</p>
<p>Tonight we endure another cold night of below 0 temperatures and strong winds. Sunday things shift and we see things start to warm up under full sun to the single digits and low teens. While winds diminish throughout the day to the 20-40mph range. All eyes focus on the Martin Luther King Day storm which will begin to affect us early Monday morning. The bulk of the snow will fall during lift operation on Monday which will make for delicious storm riding conditions. Winds appear to be in the moderate. Once this storm moves through we can all hope for the T-Bar to be able to operate to keep us skiing up high on the windiest days. Keep your fingers crossed and continue the snow dances</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
