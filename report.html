<p>Good Afternoon Skiers and Riders,</p>
<p> Those who braved the cold weather this morning were treated to the beautiful sun and crisp clear views of the surrounding mountains. It’s always a sign that the right choice has been made to go skiing when you can see out to Katahdin, Maine’s highest peak 90 miles away.</p>
<p>Snowmakers had an epic run of ideal conditions and today they brought the system offline ahead of warming temperatures that are forecasted to persist through the week. They are looking at getting things fired back up for the end of the weekend when “artic” air is forecasted to move into the area.</p>
<p>I got a chance to meet up with the Sugarloaf Terrain Park crew today and check out Stomping Grounds. I’ll just say that you can’t even tell that there is a half-pipe carved into the earth. They plan on building medium and large features in this park, including rails and jumps. With plenty of material to work with and endless enthusiasm from the STP crew, we are all very excited to see what the crew will make for us for 2022.</p>
<p>Our weather tonight calls for another cold one with temps dropping to the low teens. Then starting tomorrow morning temperatures will uptrend during the day as a storm system moves in mid-day tomorrow giving us a chance of mixed precipitation in the afternoon and throughout the night. Temps will be comfortable in the low 30s while winds elevate out of the south to around 30mph with gusts to around 60 at the summit.  Thursday the system moves out with lingering snow showers in the morning then decreasing clouds ahead of a system that has a chance to bring significant snowfall Friday into Saturday. There is still much uncertainty to the track, timing, and intensity of this storm so check back here at the Mountain Report for the developments of Friday’s system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Have a wonderful night,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
