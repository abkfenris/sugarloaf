<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Today is the day where you get to test your abilities and throw yourself against the unknown variable of a long pool of water. Not making it means a very cold and wet immediate future will slap you in the face. Good luck to all participating in the Pond Skim today, go fast and take chances.</p>
<p>The grooming team hit the hill in force last night grooming most of our available on-piste terrain hitting a variety of terrains from Bridal Chain all the way over to Haulback. For our late-season lift schedule click<a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/spring-operations-schedule"> here.</a></p>
<p>The weather today calls for overall cooler temperatures ranging from below freezing at the summit while the base will reach a high of around 45 degrees. Skies are cloudy and showers move in around lunchtime. Winds remain moderate in the 20-40mph from the NW. Tonight rain and snow showers continue with an inch of two of snow possible during the overnight ours. Sunday appears to be another cooler day with mixed precipitation. Monday the weather clears leaving us with a sunny warm day. Monday night reels in a possible late winter snowstorm that will affect us through Tuesday night. Hard to tell this early but we could get clobbered with some snow with mixing towards the end.</p>
<p>Stay Tuned,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
