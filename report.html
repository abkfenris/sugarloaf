<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Well it was a cold morning for everyone preparing for the US Alpine Championship Slalom races today, but once the blood got flowing and the sun started trying to poke her head out it turned out to be a really nice day.  Conditions are hard and fast and the racers are taking advantage of it. Be sure to <a href="/events-calendar/us-alpine-championships" title="US Alpine Championships">check out our event page</a> later today for full results and recaps. </p>
<p>Snowmakers wrapped up their spring refresh earlier today, shutting things down after about 36 hours of non-stop late-season snowmaking. Base depths were embiggened in several areas on Tote Road and Candyside that are key to extended spring operations, setting us up for the kind of lengthy spring run you expect from the King of Spring. </p>
<p>Temps will be on the rise tonight, with highs expected in the mid 30s tomorrow.  Wind should also be less of a factor for us tomorrow, particularly later in the day.  It reads to me like a day with very enjoyable weather where I’ll certainly be itching to get out there.</p>
<p>Our grooming team will hit the usual weekday suspects tonight, and with temps expected to climb abrove freezing tomorrow you can expect surfaces to soften throughout the day. Lifts tomorrow will be the same 7 as today with SuperQuad, Skyline, Snubber, Skidway and DoubleRunner East at 8:30am, followed by King Pine and Whiffletree at 9:00am.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead in the week, we have more U.S. Alpine Champiosnionships races on the way, with the the men's Giant Slalom scheduled for tomorrow, follow by the women's Giant Slalom on Thursday. </p>
<p>It looks like it’s going to warm up throughout the rest of the week and we may be expecting some precipitation so we’ll be keeping a keen eye – you just tune into the Mountain Report and we’ll have all the updates and details.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
