<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Bluebird skies and full sun were certainly what the doctor ordered for today. Winds remained calm despite the blustery forecast and those who braved skiing under the guns were treated to ample soft turns in hero snow. With an eventful weekend ahead with activities, live music, and fireworks. Today’s sunny weather is a perfect way to rejuvenate yourself with a big old dose of Vitamin D.</p>
<p>Tonight the grooming team will again take to the hill to spread their zenfull lines of corduroy all over the mountain. It is really worth it to get out there first thing to enjoy the crisp perfection of a well-groomed trail. The snowmaking crew is going to shut things down this evening and plan on returning to finish Nitro and Gondi Ext. towards the end of this week.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for temperatures to hold in the teens as clouds begin to move into the area. Monday brings us warming temperatures around 30 degrees, cloudy skies, and winds forecasted around 30-40mph. Tuesday is looking to bring us a round of precipitation. The type of precip right now isn’t certain but it appears to be a mixed bag. Looking towards the weekend we might be in for some Jerry pow to ring in the Fire on the Mountain weekend. Can’t wait to see all the tie-dye and heads milling about the mountain. My only question is. Where will Shakedown be?</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
