<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Today brought just incredible weather and calmer winds than we were expected. There skiing was a roller coaster of conditions with mostly nice corn-type snow delivering the goods. Althea told me that Fire on the Mountain is this weekend.  You can be sure we are in for a <em>long strange trip,</em> <em>so come with what you are, and what you meant to be</em> and <em>feel like a stranger</em> with us here at the Sugareeloaf.</p>
<p>Tonight the grooming department will hit the hill in force to again assist in the transition from beautiful, sunny, and warm weather to the plunge back into the arctic. Ideally, you want the snow to freeze back up before touching it to prevent it from turning into an extremely undesirable surface. So I wouldn’t be surprised to see some minor grooming holds in the morning while the crew finishes things up. Tonight would be a good night to get your skis into The Downhill Supply Company for a fresh tune for tomorrow’s fast conditions.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for falling temperatures and heightened winds. With snowmelt and water present on the road please be careful tonight while traveling around as things are going to start freezing just after the lifts close. Tomorrow we are looking at another sunny day with temps in the single digits and low-teens. Winds are forecasted in the 35-55mph range from the NW. Looking ahead to Friday’s storm it’s looking like we are in the 4-7 inch range for anticipated snowfall, starting mid-morning and continuing through the day. All you Dead Heads better get your excuses prepared for your superiors Friday because who doesn’t want to do a little storm riding before boogying down to <em>some Uncle John’s Band</em>?</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
