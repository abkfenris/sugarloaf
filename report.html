<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Well the <em>music never stopped </em>last night keeping all the heads dancing well into the <em>midnight hour</em>.  We’ve got one more musical performance by Sans Souchi from 1:00 to 4:00 pm to bring our Fire on the Mountain weekend to a close. And what a weekend is has been with storm skiing, bluebird riding, a nonstop boogying with <em>brown eyed women and red grenadine. </em></p>
<p>The grooming team last night hit the hill hard and groomed most of our piste terrain. A few trails like Upper Gondi and Lower White Nitro were left off the groom list because of snowmaking operations above. With snowmaking wrapping up on Gondi Extension and White Nitro this morning the grooming department will aim to get us skiing down our steepest trails at Sugarloaf in the very near future.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for cloudy skies with snow showers and squalls possible in the afternoon. Temps will be pleasant in the mid-20s. A live report just came in from TOS where they recorded winds 30-40mph with higher gusts and currently Skyline is looking marginal for operations. Arctic air sets in again overnight bringing lows of around zero to the base of the mountain. Light snow showers continue into early AM Monday before clouds move out leaving us with a cold and partially sunny day.  </p>
<p>Make sure to stay tuned here at the mountain report or on Twitter @sugarloafsnow for all the latest lift updates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris<br/><br/></p>
