<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> Winds have calmed, the temps have risen, and the moon shines, a sure sign for today to be a real dandy. Which almost any day could be if you compared it to yesterday. We are looking to have 11 lifts, 52 trails, on 303 acres of terrain for today’s snow riders.</p>
<p>Our snowmaking crew last night maintained operations on Comp Hill and Sidewinder. The groomers set out on a mission and buttered out all our open terrain. The lift department this morning reported winds 15-20mph at the top of SuperQuad which is a good sign we’re hoping to have full lift operations today.</p>
<p>The Weather today calls sunny skies and temps in the single digits on the upper-mountain and low teens around the base. Winds are moderate in the 20-35mph range. Tonight temps remain cold and then things quickly warm up tomorrow morning ahead of the MLK day storm. We are still on track to get 8-12 inches of snow throughout the day tomorrow.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
