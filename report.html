<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>We are looking to have a wonderful day on our hands. The winds are dying and the temps are reasonable finally giving us a little reprieve from the elements. With snow in the forecast, terrain expansion, and temps taking a dive this weekend, it appears we have a lot to look forward to leading into our Christmas festivities.</p>
<p>Last night our snowmaking team exploited a cold weather window, and made snow on Sluice, Boardwalk, and Lower Scoot. Temperatures appear to be going into the border line zone today so we will just have to see if they will be able to keep guns running. The grooming team spread their corduroy love on all of our open terrain last night. Plus getting Windrow ready to be opened for today.</p>
<p>Today we will experience increasing clouds ahead of tonights storm. Winds are forecasted to be around 15-30mph, with temps in the mid to upper twenties. Tonight snow arrives around 8pm and continues into the morning dropping one to three inches. As the bulk of the storm moves through tomorrow morning it appears to drag some warm air in behind it causing some mixed precipitation on the back end. So keep your fingers crossed, do your snow dance, or sacrifice a pair of skis cause I know all of you want to be skiing that organic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Also on Saturday is our annual <a href="/events-calendar/tree-lighting-festival" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tree Lighting Festival</a>—and Santa Claus will be coming to town, accompanied by Amos and friends! Come celebrate the season in Sugarloaf style with warm treats, music on the Beach, fireworks, and more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Enjoy your day</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris</p>
