<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>What an exciting way to start the week! Fresh snow, cold temps and tons of skiing. It seems like the temps will be a bit colder today so break out your favorite wooly socks and brew up some strong coffee or delicious hot cocoa and meet us on the mountain for first chair and clear skies.</p>
<p>It seems that the single digit temps this morning will give way to mid to low teens with a bright sunny sky. The groomers got to all your favorite open trails last night so skiing and snowboarding should be crisp this morning and let’s not forget to take some time to appreciate the snowmakers who are gearing up to run in this cold. It’s a tough job and they are hard workers!</p>
<p> Forecasts for the Mountain are calling for calm clear skies throughout the day with a base temp of 20 and a peak temp of around 13. There seems to be some winter fronts moving in and out this week so temps will likely fluctuate and winds will pick up between the 20-40 mph. But we live in Maine and won’t know for sure until the weather is right on top of us.</p>
<p> Have a great morning </p>
<p>David</p>
