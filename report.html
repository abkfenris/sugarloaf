<p>Good Afternoon,</p>
<p>Despite a few lingering clouds, this afternoon turned into the perfect spring day with temperatures in the mid-to-high fifties and a seemingly endless supply of corn snow. With 6 days left in the 2021/22 season, we’re still skiing near wall-to-wall coverage on more than 70 trails, spanning more than 350 acres.</p>
<p>Despite what the calendar will tell you, tomorrow, we’ll see more mid-winter conditions with decreasing temperatures and possible rain/snow showers depending on where you are skiing and riding. Throughout the next few days, temperatures will be settled in the mid-to-high twenties, so don’ go packing away your long johns just yet.</p>
<p>Now that we're deep into the spring skiing season, you should expect surfaces to be pretty firm in the mornings, before they loosen up later in the day as temps rise. These freeze thaw cycles make for great corn snow, but they also mean that you may find some trails roped off in the mornings until snow softens enough for Ski Patrol to open them up. During this time of year, the open trail count you see on this report is a reflection of the trails we expect to open at some point during the day, once surfaces soften.</p>
<p>The grooming team will be light this evening but have plans to smooth surfaces on 12 trails, including Tote Road, Kings Landing, and Sluice. We’ll see the same two late-season – SuperQuad and Skyline – spinning at 8:30am tomorrow, and for those of you planning you’re last ski days of the season, you can find our complete spring lift schedule <a href="/spring-operations-schedule">here.</a></p>
<p>Until tomorrow.<br/>Noelle</p>
