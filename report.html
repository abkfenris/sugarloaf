<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Winter might be done where you live but we are still snow riding and going strong here at Sugarloaf. With the National Ski Races coming to a close, the Jah vibes will start to settle in across the mountain and we can relax, ski, and enjoy the sunset of the 2022 ski season.</p>
<p>Grooming operations were limited overnight due to rain and warm temperatures. Cats are currently grooming Tote Road, Sluice, and a few trails on the lower mountain. Generally trails should be soft with spring like conditions.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for cloudy skies with a chance of rain/snow showers, with temperatures reaching highs in the upper 40s around the base. Winds are calm with gusts only reaching around 30mph at the summit. We look to be settling into a nice corn cycle for the coming days with warm sunny days and cold clear nights.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
