<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Looking at the radar this morning brings a smile when you see a large system spanning from western Maine all the way down to Atlanta, Georgia. Flurries are just getting started here at the base of the mountain, so we are looking at a true best of both worlds day. Snow riders will be able to enjoy pristine and smooth corduroy in the morning, then slash soft powder turns after lunch.</p>
<p>Last night the snowcats groomed out a host of terrain leaving all of our on-piste trails with pristine grooves and ridges. The Lift Maintenance crew is out and about this morning assessing winds at all of our lifts, and TOS report just came in monitoring 40-50mph winds with higher gusts, and that Skyline is starting on wind hold. However, the SuperQuad looks good to turn with winds only 25-35mph at the top station. Today is the annual Sugarloaf Banked Slalom race which will take place starting this morning on Sidewinder. Racing can be viewed from the SuperQuad or accessing the bottom of Sidewinder from Lower Narrow Gauge. Good luck to all 100+ competitors today.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for heavy snow, 5-9” inches of it is expected to fall throughout the day. Temps are mild in the upper 20s and low 30s. The winds are forecasted from the S/SW at 40-70mph at the summit.  Tonight another 2-4” of snow is forecasted to fall along with cooling temperatures. Sunday looks like things will clear up to reveal sunny skies with continued strong winds at 30-40mph on the upper mountain, gusts to 65mph at the summit. Temperatures tomorrow cool to the teens at the base and single digits at the summit.</p>
<p>Remember to always look out for one another on the slopes and ski in control. Obey all posted signs and trail closures, they are there for a reason. With strong blustery storm winds forecasted throughout the day winds holds are likely. Please attempt to fight the powder panic and enjoy the return of soft wintery conditions to our beloved mountain!</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
