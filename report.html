<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>If you're headed our way today look for 45 open trails spanning 268 acres. Last night groomers were out and about prepping 37 trails with fresh corduroy. High temps will be in the single digits, so pack your puffy coat and some extra hand warmers. Winds are forecasted strong and steady in the 30-50mph range, so be sure to check in here at the Mountain Report or on Twitter for any updates on lift status. We'll have seven lifts scheduled to turn for you today, winds and weather permitting. The King Pine lift will not run Monday-Wednesday this week, but terrain in the King Pine Bowl will be accessible from the Skyline lift. King Pine will be back open on Thursday. </p>
<p>Snowmakers shut things down yesterday as the weather moved in, and they will take a 48 hour break while this week's arctic blast passes through.  By Tuesday morning we'll be well below zero, and we'll likely stay that way until Wednesday morning. Snowmakers will fire things back up on Wednesday, with Timberline and Sidewinder in their sights. </p>
<p>A note on snowmaking: while it is possible for us to keep making snow through extreme cold snaps like we're expecting Monday and Tuesday (overnight lows are expected to be around 20 below zero up on the mountain), it does present a unique set of risks - both to the snowmaking infrastructure and to the snowmakers themselves. If anything unexpected occurs, snowmakers need to be able to react instantly to prevent frozen pipes and damage to equipment. With forecasts calling for favorable snowmaking conditions from Wednesday on, we've elected to give our snowmakers a well-deserved rest on Monday and Tuesday, and avoid the added risk to the system. </p>
<p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
