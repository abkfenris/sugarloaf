<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Well friends, the mountain had a rough night and she is going to need to just chill today. Overnight, she was up there at that massive party up in the sky, they made such a ruckus, and, personally, between you and me, I think she might have had one to many eggnogs getting in the holiday spirit. Don’t you worry, we’ll get her back in shape for you tomorrow.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>With cold temperatures arriving this afternoon, the snowmaking crew was able to get things fired up on Tote Road and Stomping Grounds. Tonight, the grooming squad will be out in force working to buff out as much terrain as they. Tomorrow, we are scheduled to run 5 lifts, giving you access to our 24 open trails.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Overnight, we should see winds diminish slightly, with temperatures hanging in the 20s. Weather-wise, tomorrow’s forecast suggests we’ll see another warm-ish day with temperatures by the base hanging around 35 degrees. Skies are forecasted to be partly cloudy with a few pockets of sun. Looking into the week, colder temperatures arrive on Tuesday, with the next storm due Wednesday night.</p>
<p><o:p></o:p>Wishing you all a fun and productive beginning to your week,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
