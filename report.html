<p>TGIF Skiers and Riders,</p>
<p>As another storm passes us by and wastes its bountiful offerings on the ocean, I do admit my morale wavers. However, we still have the beautiful, consistent, and almost perfect fall line of Sugarloaf, with a solid variety of terrain, to comfort such thoughts and feelings. With a few inches possible today and a sunny day ahead on Saturday there is much to enjoy at the moment. Today King Pine and Timberline lifts will return to action, and our trail count bumps to 46 with the addition of another Hot Doggin’ classic, Haulback.</p>
<p>Last night the grooming department hit the hill and groomed out all of our open trails besides Choker and Skidder. They also currently putting the finishing touches on Haulback. Snowmakers are on stand-by waiting to get things fired up on West Mountain, Scoot, and Sidewinder. The park crew continued sculpting the new Stomping Grounds Terrain Park, which they have made considerable progress.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for 1-3” of snow, cloudy skies, with winds in the 15-30mph range, and temps in the low 20s and high teens. Tonight’s temperatures plummet to the single digits around the base and the winds elevate slightly. Any lingering snow showers may drop another inch on top of what we see today. Saturday is looking to be a wonderful day of skiing with sunny skies and temperatures in the low teens, cold enough to make you enjoy that hot chocolate just a little bit more than normal. Winds diminish into Saturday becoming calm. Happy Friday</p>
<p>Safe Travels</p>
