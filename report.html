<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>As the warm weather continues and you can start thinking about leaving your buff at home and replacing your chapstick with sunscreen. It is kind of hard to believe that April is just 2 weeks away. We received a light dusting of snow overnight which should leave the trails in fine condition for this morning’s snow sliding.</p>
<p>The grooming team buffed a large swath of terrain last night leaving us 66 trails of corduroy. Our trail count received a nice boost after this past weekend’s storm, and with the possibility of another storm this weekend and warm temperatures we can only hope for more.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for temps in the mid-30s which after a long winter of temps around 0 just feels like an absolute delight to the skin. Expect areas of fog and clouds this morning, then things gradually clear to sunny skies, winds remain moderate from the west 20-40mph. Looking ahead to the next few days temps appear to be hot with daytime temperatures in the upper 40s. Then things cool off over the weekend as we are looking to be affected by another storm Saturday through Sunday. Details aren’t concrete yet but we’ll get you the skinny when forecasts show more confidence.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
