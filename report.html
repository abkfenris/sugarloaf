<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Wowzers, what a <em>sunshine daydream </em>out there today. It warmed my <em>foolish heart </em>to see people out there rippin the rope drops getting that bluebird cold smoke this morning, and the soft n supple groomers that just about achieved perfection from yesterday’s snow. With one more night of <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/events-calendar/fire-on-the-mountain">Fire on the Mountain</a> left it’s your best chance to cut loose and <em>get that feel good music, in your soul.</em></p>
<p>Ski patrol today went on a rope dropping spree giving us an extra 20 trails to <em>discover the wonders of nature </em>on this morning. The grooming department will again be hitting the hill tonight to do what they do best and deliver us with Zen gardens of corduroy for tomorrows grateful shred. The snowmaking department will continue operations tonight on the summit try to deliver the final push to get us skiing on Sugarloafs steepest terrain White Nitro and Gondi Extension.</p>
<p>The weather tonight brings us cooling temps down to the low teens around the base and calm winds. Clouds and wind move in during the overnight hours bringing us warmer temps for Sunday in the 20s. Sunday afternoon brings the chance of snow showers/squalls which could result in a quick 1 or 2 inches. Looking at the long term forecast it appears we’ll be <em>waiting for a miracle</em> as there are no significant snow storms In the immediate future. However this coming week appears to bring seasonal temps in the 20, while skies remain mostly for a majority of the week.</p>
<p><em>Make yourself easy,</em></p>
<p><em>Chris</em></p>
