<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>It’s amazing how perspective shapes reality. After a proper January with temperatures that averaged around what seemed like zero degrees. One can now walk outside to temps around freezing and the air is gentle and comforting. The days grow longer and the sun inches higher over Sugarloaf and you start to think of warm afternoons on the Bullwinkle’s deck and skiing corn in a t-shirt. However, before those blissful days arrive. We have the true meats of winter on deck for February with more powder skiing and cold snow.</p>
<p>The snowmakers last night has to shut down operations after a successful run on Sluice Chute, Wedge, and Dropline due to warm temps. With some more wild weather on the way they’ll just clear the mountain and remain offline until next week. The grooming department hit the hill last night and hit most of our on-piste terrain. Make sure to check below for a detailed grooming list. With strong winds forecasted today do not rule out the possibility of winds holds.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for temps in the upper 20s and low 30s with gusty winds from the SW blowing to 55mph on the upper mountain. Skies are cloudy. Tonight and tomorrow bring a mixed bag of light sleet and snow before all switching over to snow for another dynamic storm that is looking to cake us with what we really need. Heavy creamy snow. More on the upcoming storm this afternoon.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
