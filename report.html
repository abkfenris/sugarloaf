<p>Happy Saturday Loafers,</p>
<p> It appears we have a lovely day on our hands today. Currently at 6AM, skies are clear, wind is calm, and the stars are twinkling away. No matter how your week went or how much of the dip you’ve been eating, you should be sure to set your worries aside and enjoy the present, grab your favorite pal and head for the shred. Today we have 18 trails scheduled to open serviced by 4 lifts.</p>
<p> Last night our snowmakers maintained operations on Gin Pole, Spillway, Lower Winter’s, and the Birches. With the temps in the single digits and the wind dying off early this morning. I am indeed very excited to ride Skyline today (<strong>opening at 10am</strong>) and scope out how that Carrabassett Cream has piled up on Spillway. Don’t expect to be heading east first thing. Our patrollers need to get eyes on Gin Pole, Spillway, and Lower Winters to set up ropes and mark hazards before they can lets folks journey that way. The groomers are currently working diligently to have these new offerings ready for the day.</p>
<p> Today’s weather is looking to be quite pleasant, with temps in the upper teens, and NW winds in the 20-30MPH range. The cool temps will hang out through the day and then start dropping in the afternoon to the low teens and single digits for tonight. Allowing the snowmakers to continue piling up product on your favorite trails. Tonight a minor disturbance rolls in forecasted to drop around an inch of snow, then clearing again to partly sunny skies for tomorrow.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that there will be no beginner terrain available from the top of either lift. uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em></p>
<p>Catch you right here in the afternoon,</p>
<p>Chris </p>
