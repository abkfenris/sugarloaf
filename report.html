<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Was it just me, or did this morning feel more like a movie trailer for the latest Final Destination film than a day on the ski slopes? From thunder snow to a power outage, there was no shortage of irregularities to keep us all on our toes. But Sugarloafers did as Sugarloafers do and responded swiftly to the challenges with grace and patience as we got things back up and running. Things calmed down by mid-morning, allowing us all to get back to our regularly-scheduled shredding and Christmas Vacationing.</p>
<p>Thanks to the heavy dusting of snow overnight, the skiing and riding conditions were soft and buttery – which made for many smiling faces. With continued snowmaking efforts underway on the east side of the mountain, we’ll have even more reason to smile tomorrow, as the King Pine lift is scheduled to start up for the season, adding access to some of you favorite trails in the King Pine Bowl.</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s forecast is calling for mild conditions with partly sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-teens at the summit and low-twenties around the base. Weather-wise, we’ll be in a lull before the next storm system moves in Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Our vacation week lift schedule has ten lifts set to spin tomorrow, beginning with Snubber at 8am, followed by Skyline, Double Runner, Whiffletree, King Pine, Skidway, and Sawduster at 8:30am, then Timberline a 9am. Stay tuned right here or follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/SugarloafSnow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@SugarloafSnow</a> for the latest updates on trail and lift status. </p>
