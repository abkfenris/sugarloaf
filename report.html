<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Conditions on the mountain today remained superb with soft and shreddy groomers. Journeying off the piste revealed pockets of snow blown in between moguls of varying softness. Despite the storm last week, willy whacks and thin cover are present on natural snow terrain. However, if the storm pans out over the weekend we have a really good chance of saying goodbye to the shrubbery and possibly start adventuring into more of our legendary gladed terrain.</p>
<p>With an eventful weekend ahead the grooming department will hit the hill hard tonight and spread love to all of our snowmaking terrains. Tomorrow will be the public debut of the Sidewinder Boarder Cross Park. For Saturday the lift department has 11 lifts scheduled to run and service our 473 acres of terrain.</p>
<p>Tonight temperatures drop back into the single digits and winds persist around 25mph.  Currently, we are forecasted to receive around 8-12+ inches of snow starting tomorrow late morning and wrapping up early Sunday. Winds tomorrow remain moderate in the 20-35 mph range, which should allow full lift operations for Saturday. The winds however pick up in intensity as the bulk of the storm settles in Saturday afternoon where the upper mountain will see winds 40-65mph. Sunday things calm slightly where winds reach about 55mph on the summit. This is definitely an iffy wind speed for lift operations. However, the wind direction plays a crucial role in whether lifts can remain open or not.  The wind mitigation built for the Skyline and SuperQuad lifts was designed to protect from prevailing winds from the W/NW. So it is possible for some of our upper mountain lifts to continue running for a bountiful powder harvest on Sunday. If all else fails we always have the 3 T-Bar which is the ultimate trick up the sleeve for getting in your powder fix. </p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
