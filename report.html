<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>What a day of fun and diverse weather, good old New England weather. With a few clear, sunny, and pleasant days forecasted for this weekend, you can bet there is no better time to enjoy the last bits of winter with us here at Sugarloaf where we are skiing wall to wall on most of your favorite on-piste trails.</p>
<p>The grooming team tonight will be hitting the hill in force smoothing out surfaces on a variety of trails over our 300+ acres of open terrain. As is common this time of year with near-freezing temperatures after hours, natural terrain starts out pretty stiff in the morning, so Ski Patrol may temporarily limit skiing and riding to groomed trails only until snow surfaces soften up with the rising temperatures. We'll keep you posted with the latest right here in the Mountain Report.</p>
<p>For lifts tomorrow, we have the same three late-season staples scheduled to spin at 8:30am: SuperQuad, Skyline, and Double Runner East. And for those of you making plans for your last turns of the season, you can find our <a href="/spring-operations-schedule">complete spring lift operation schedule here.</a> </p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for clear skies and elevated winds. Saturday brings us a nice sunny day with temperatures reaching a high of the mid-to-upper 40s at the base area. Winds mellow out tomorrow with speeds ranging from 20-35mph from the NW. Sunday looks to be a repeat of Saturday with clear sunny weather with highs exceeding 50 degrees around the base. This coming week looks to bring more active weather as we head into the final glimpses of the 2022 ski season.</p>
<p>Can’t wait to see you here,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
