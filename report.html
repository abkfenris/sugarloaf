<p><strong>UPDATE:  Strong winds are impacting lift operations this morning. Please check the lift report below for current lift status.- 8:03am</strong></p>
<p>Good morning Riders of the Storm,</p>
<p>Yesterday and last night mother-nature put on a spectacular show in the way of snow, wind, and swirl. At the base this morning we have 6” of snow from overnight putting us at 8” total from the storm. Strong winds prevailed throughout the night and to the present, so expect some places to be wind-scoured and others to be deeeeep.</p>
<p>Last night the groomers hit the mountain to smooth out all on-piste green circle and blue square terrain. Ski Patrollers yesterday already started dropping ropes around the mountain, including the Sugarloaf classic Bubblecuffer from Spillway Cross Cut. The lift department has been on the hill assessing winds since 5:30 am. So far we know that it’s windy. Skyline is on wind hold, and they are currently winching the drifts out on the T-Bar Line. Check back here for updates or @sugarloafsnow on twitter for the latest.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for decreasing clouds and temps around zero degrees on the Upper Mountain and around ten degrees at the base. Winds currently are strong in the 40-50mph with reported gusts higher at TOS. The good news is the winds are forecasted to calm down eventually, and you can bet our lift department will be closely monitoring wind speeds and will open lifts as soon as it’s safe. Tonight temperatures drop again to a low around zero at the base and winds lulling to the 15-30mph range. Tomorrow calls for increasing clouds, afternoon snow showers, and temps warming to the teens.</p>
<p>Have fun out there today Sugarloafers, be safe, be patient, and look out for one another. As always ski with caution, especially if exploring trails off the piste for the first time. Stump, rocks, and down trees may present themselves to you at any moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All good things and all good times,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
