<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Here we are entering the first full week of April.  I hope that everyone is getting physically, mentally and emotionally prepared for Reggae Festival this week: April 7th - April 10th.  It’s shaping up to be another warm week that may even be punctuated with some snow this weekend.</p>
<p>Monday will kick us off strong with temperatures forecasted 37-41 at base, 25-29 at top.  Moderate winds are being recorded this morning but everything is set to operate on schedule thus far.  Expect cloud coverage in the morning that will decrease substantially throughout the day.</p>
<p>Last night our talented groomers were out in force striping up our on-piste terrain to prepare for the week ahead.  They deserve a lot of credit for the work they’ve been doing to maintain our hill throughout this stretch of variable weather.  Lift capacity will be decreasing slowly as we move closer to the end of the season.  Our weekday usual moving forward will look like today with 5 lifts scheduled to run: SuperQuad, Skyline, Snubber, Skidway and DRC East all open to public at 8:30am.</p>
<p>Despite what it might look like wherever home is for you – there’s plenty of snow still on the mountain here at Sugarloaf.  Our coverage is holding up substantially with 72 trails, 361 acres or 30 miles of terrain still open.  Spurline, Stomping Grounds, Dropline and Sidewinder are all still open for ripping terrain park action.  Don’t miss out on spring skiing this week.  Extended forecast details to come in afternoon report.</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
