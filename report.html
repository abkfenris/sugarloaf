<p style="text-align: justify;">Good afternoon skiers and riders,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today was a little bit of shock, sliding around in the cold temperatures after a few days of warm weather, but it’s time to harden up, because winter is coming our way and things appear to be going full-swing into this coming week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The snowmaking crew is going to attempt battling the storm to keep operations alive on Whiffletree, Spillway X-Cut, Lombard X-Cut, and the Bullwinkle’s area. The park crew is working with what they have, and created a new 3 new box/rail features skiers left of the islands on the upper section of Tote Road. The grooming team will be heading out on the hill tonight to cover all of our open terrain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Weather tonight is calling for 5 to 8 inches of snow by Sunday morning; winds will remain moderate during the overnight hours and into Sunday, staying in the 15 to 30 mph range. Expect clouds and temperatures in the 20s tomorrow. Sunday night, skies will start to clear, and Monday is looking to be a glorious day with sun and soft snow. Enjoy the<span> <a href="/events-calendar/tree-lighting-festival" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tree Lighting Festival </a></span><span>tonight and we'll catch you right here in the morning with the latest snow totals. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cheers Sugarloafers,</p>
