<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Well, the good news is that today looks like the end of the wet weather for this week. I hope you've used the last couple of days to get caught up on all your chores because forecasts are calling for sunshine and temperatures in the fifties tomorrow.  And I don't know about you, but I can't think of a better way to kick off the weekend than with the King of Spring, and more than 370 acres of ripe corn spanning 73 open trails. </p>
<p>The grooming team will once again have their work cut out for them tonight, as saturated snow surfaces make for slow going. But conditions permitting, they'll lay fresh stripes on the usual spring suspects between Tote Road and Ramdown. </p>
<p>And while this week's weather may have left some of you yearning to get seedlings in the ground, the only gardening we'll be doing here for the next 2+ weeks is harvesting corn – with plans to keep the lifts spinning through May 1st. Tomorrow's lift schedule features 4 lifts including Skyline, King Pine, Double Runner, and SuperQuad. And, for a complete late-season lift schedule, visit our spring operations page linked <a href="/spring-operations-schedule">here</a>. </p>
<p>That's all for now<br/>Noelle</p>
