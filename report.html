<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> Sunny skies and balmy temperatures facilitated a wonderful day of snow riding at Sugarloaf. Winds have stiffened and forced wind holds on Skyline and Timberline, but the snow is soft, the visibility far, and the smiles big. Always love to see delightful weather for Maine Day.</p>
<p>With Mother Nature now being concerned about the Sugarloafers well-being, the Snowmakers will remain offline until sometime next week. The to-do list for snowmakers is pretty small with only Nitro, Gondi, and Gauge Extensions left to tackle. The grooming list is limited tonight due to warm weather and precip so make sure to check here in the morning for the detailed report. The park crew will be out sculpting their newest and final park for the season in Drop Line which is rumored to feature a big-air style jump.</p>
<p>Eventually, these sunny skies will give way to clouds and precipitation. Tonight temperatures remain in the upper 20s and low 30s as superficial sleet and snow showers move in. Wind remains strong from the SW at speeds 40-60mph on the upper mountain. This weather persists into Thursday so anticipate wind holds tomorrow. Thursday night is when things start to turn heads. Temperatures drop down the mid-teens and winds subside slightly to the 30-50mph range. Currently, we are forecasted at a total of 8-12” of snow when this storm wraps up and heads out Friday evening. Make sure to have your favorite ailment ready for your boss Thursday night because Friday is looking to be a real banger.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
