<p>Happy Easter Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Driving in this morning was quite a sight with a gigantic moon settling over the Crocker’s, while the faint morning light softly illuminated the snow-covered peaks of Carrabassett Valley. The grooming operators are reporting around an inch of snow on the upper mountain this morning. It is always incredible what an inch of snow can do to a mountain.</p>
<p>The grooming team last night tackled a variety of terrain from Lower Timberline and Bridal Chain, to Widowmaker and Flume. Also, today from 11:30-2 pm is the Season Pass Holder BBQ from 11:30-2 pm outside the Shipyard. The Lift Ops crew will be turning the Sawduster Lift from 12-2 to get you back up the hill for some afternoon turns.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for partial sun then becoming cloudy as mixed precipitation moves over the mountain for the afternoon and evening. Otherwise, temperatures will be cooler today with freezing temps at the summit and highs reaching the mid-40s around the base. Tomorrow the skies clear and we are looking at another classic spring day of sunny skies and temperatures in the 50s. Tuesday is looking to be a late-season snow day with 3-5 inches possible in the preliminary forecasts. Keep your fingers crossed!</p>
<p>Stay tuned,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
