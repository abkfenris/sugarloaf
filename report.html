<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s incredible how far a little bit of snow can go. The isolated flurries and squalls we’ve experienced over the past 6 hours have left just enough snow on the trails to notice. Today’s Sugarloafers were able to zoom further east as anyone has this year, down the Peavey X-Cut over to the nice sustained straight shot of Lower Gauge, a place where you can go to really test out your carving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today Mother Nature decided to give the snow guns a break; the makers, however. are still out and about getting Spillway ready to fire up on Friday. We've certainly had a good push of snowmaking, which means plenty of grooming in the meantime; they'll be out tonight hitting our open terrain as well as working on getting the rest of Narrow Gauge ready, which is no easy task.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tonight, look for temperatures in the mid 20s and winds out of the southwest at 15 to 20mph. Cloudy skies will persist into tomorrow with snow showers starting in the afternoon. As the night goes on, temperatures will warm and the snow may turn to a mixed variety. Currently an inch or so is forecasted to fall on us by Friday morning, which we know from today can go a long way.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that there will be no beginner terrain available from the top of either lift, and uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em></p>
<p>Catch you right here in the morning,</p>
<p>Chris </p>
