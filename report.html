<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Keith Carson last night said Sugarloaf is appearing to be in the “perfect spot” to possibly see over a foot of snow come Monday. If that’s just not a mid 70’s “<em>Morning Dew</em>” to your ears, it might be time to pull the trigger on that cheap flight to Ecuador. A great friend whom I’ve spent many a season with chasing powder in Utah once brilliantly told me that “You can’t ski the forecast” So we might as well hit the hill today and get warmed up, so we aren’t retreating to Bullwinkles at 10 am on monday.</p>
<p>The Mountain Operations department had a busy night last night making snow and grooming. The snowmakers had to reduce operations on the lower mountain due to warm temperatures, but are still maintaining operations on Timberline. With the temps dropping today rest assured they’ll be back in action on Sidewinder ASAP. The grooming squad hit the mountain last night and canvased most of our open terrain with corduroy and also putting the finishing touches on West Mountain. Make sure to check below for today’s grooming report. The Lift Department will be running West Mountain today for test runs but will not be open to the public.</p>
<p>The weather today is looking to be quite friendly barring some healthy winds. Temperatures currently are in the upper 20s and winds are forecasted today to be from the NW at a respectable 25-45mph throughout the mountain. From this morning and on temperatures will start their decline towards the below zero mark. We are forecasted to see temperatures as low as -15 overnight at the base. Remember if you just can’t bare the cold you can always go visit the Sugarloaf Health and Fitness Center and treat yourself to a slice of pizza and some hot tubs.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
