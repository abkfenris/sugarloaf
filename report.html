<p style="text-align: justify;">Good afternoon, Sugarloaf skiers and riders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With over two feet of natural snow this month, including the 8 inches that accumulated over the weekend, the mountain is in the best shape of the season (so far!) and I’m happy to report that we started the week with 93 open trails spanning just shy of 500 acres, plus 5 terrain parks to play in with ropes dropping on Sidewinder this morning. Word from the STP scene says this course is one of the best builds in recent times, making it a must-not-miss for terrain park enthusiasts; the crew even had help from professional BX course builder Shawn Clauson. I headed to the hill mid-morning to see for myself and can confirm, Sidewinder is skiing exceptionally well! If you haven't already given it a go, be sure to try 'er out in your afternoon on-hill adventures.</p>
<p>Tonight, the snow cats will leave the barnyard in full force, taking on their usual list of terrain-to-tackle; meanwhile, our tireless team of Sugarloaf snowmakers will continue their march of expansion, blowing snow on Drop Line, Sluice Headwall, and Wedge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking ahead to tomorrow, Tuesday is forecasted to have a continuation of calm weather with winds less than 25 miles per hour predicated, paired with partly skies and temperatures on the milder side of seasonal; if you’re planning to head to the hill, dress for mid-to-upper teens at the top with low-to-mid 20s by the base. Temperatures are expected to continue their trend of moderation into midweek, with the next opportunity for snow Thursday into Friday; we anticipate to see a crash back to cold Friday night, just in time for the weekend. All in all, I’d say it’s shaping up to be a great week to get away to the mountains of Western Maine; come spend some quality time outside with family and friends, or solo, on our slopes. Start drafting those out-of-office emails now, Sugarloafers…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happy last day of January, everybody—1 month of 2022 down, 11 to go!  I hope you’ve made the most of your Monday here in the mountains of Maine. </p>
