<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8:45AM UPDATE - temps are dropping fast and it's starting to set up like a skating rink out there. Any ungroomed terrain is recommended for experts only. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, boys and girls, it’s a good day for a Goretex jacket and lobsterman bibs. The rain has been coming down at a pretty good clip since yesterday afternoon, and it’s going to be a bit soggy out there today. On the flip side, temps will start dropping back down later in the day, with up to five inches of accumulation possible this evening. So as Van Morrison would say, ‘When it’s not always raining, there’ll be days like this.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We’re seeing temperatures in the low-to-mid-thirties this morning, with rain showers expected to taper off later in the day as cooler air moves in and precipitation changes over to snow. Probably a good idea to pack an extra pair of socks and sense of adventure if you’re heading up to the hill today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our groomers were out smoothing surfaces on 35 trails last night including Tote Road, Kings Landing, Narrow Gauge, Widowmaker and Whiffletree, so expect plenty of soft, slushy cord out there this morning. However with temperatures expected to drop steadily throughout the day, we may start to see surfaces at higher elevation set up as the day goes on, which could impact open terrain later this afternoon. As always, we’ll keep you posted with the latest right here, and on our <a href="twitter.com/sugarloafsnow">@SugarloafSnow</a> account on Twitter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have 10 lifts scheduled to spin for you today, with the SuperQuad and Skyline opening at 7:30am for our First Tracks pass holders. Winds look to be fairly mild  and we don't expect them to cause any issues in terms of lift operations, but we'll keep you posted right here with any changes throughout the day. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See you out there,<br/>Noelle </p>
