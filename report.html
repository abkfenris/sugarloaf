<p><strong>SuperQuad and Skidway on maintenance hold. -8:22am</strong></p>
<p>Good Morning Skiers and Riders,</p>
<p> Well folks it’s the coldest day of the season thus far and if you choose to ski and ride today, that is your beautiful decision, and we’ll be here turning the lifts for you. Remember frostbite can strike after just 1 fast run down Tote Road to an exposed nose tip. So be careful and look out for each other today.  Don’t hesitate to head over to Downhill Supply Company and get the best equipment for extreme cold. Today we are scheduled to run 7 lifts, on 47 trails, 41 of which are groomed.</p>
<p>Our grooming team went out and groomed most of our open terrain with the exception of Haulback. Most of the snowmaking team is probably warm in their beds reveling in the fact that they are not on the hill in such weather. However, there are likely a few of them who lie there disappointed because they are indeed twisted animals who treasure being on the mountain in such extreme environments. The park crew today will be putting the finishing touches on Stomping Grounds Park, which includes setting rails, hand sculpting ramps, then finally laying down fresh corduroy to then be shredded by the park rats.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for partly cloudy skies, moderate winds in the 25-35mph, and high temperatures at the base reaching -2. Currently, the top of Skyline is sitting at a healthy -22 degrees pushing -50 with the windchill. High towards the top of the mountain is forecasted to be around -13 degrees. Tonight cold temperatures persist, then eventually start an uptrend early Wednesday morning where we will see the return of above 0 temperatures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stay warm,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
