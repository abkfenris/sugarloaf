<p><strong>9:34am UPDATE: Winds are impacting lift operations today. Please check the lift report below for details.</strong></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The snow is falling and we currently have a dusting of snow around the base of the mountain. With 1-2 inches of snow forecasted to fall today and mixing occurring at some point later on. Be sure to come up early and take advantage of some fresh all-natural.</p>
<p>The grooming team last night was able to hit all of our snowmaking terrain and further refine the frozen granular snow we’ve been shredding the last few days. I did hear yesterday that snowmaking will be coming online towards the end of the weekend to keep us wiggling well into the spring season.</p>
<p> Warm air has infiltrated this storm sooner than anticipated and we are looking at less snow and more ice/sleet. Temperatures remain right around freezing throughout the mountain today while winds ramp up from the SE to the 20-45 mph range. This reckless pattern of inconsistent precipitation type continues throughout the night and into tomorrow. The rest of the weekend looks like chances of snow showers and temps remain around freezing with winds remaining in the moderate category.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
