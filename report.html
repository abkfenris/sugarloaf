<p>Good afternoon, Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The air out there today was quite comfortable.  Temperatures were warm and wind was mild as the sun stayed hidden behind cloud cover for most of the day.  Many of the trails that we’ve been itching to hit all winter are finally open like Brackett Basin and White Nitro.  We have entered the prime time of the season folks.</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s weather should be similar, perhaps even warmer.  Forecast shows 30-34 at base, 22-26 at top with NNE 6-10mph and SW 14-20mph respectively.  Once again we are expecting mostly cloudy skies with potential for some light snow flurries. </p>
<p>Tonight snowmaking is still off but the groomers will be hard at work.  They will be hitting Haulback and Spillway in addition to their normal weekday schedule.  Lifts will be the same 8 as they were today.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead into this week we expect these warmer temperatures to last through Thursday where we see a chance of snow showers occurring.</p>
<p>Let’s get after it again tomorrow!</p>
<p>Brady</p>
