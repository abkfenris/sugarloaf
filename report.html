<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The last day of US Alpine Nationals was a success as the Women’s Giant Slalom runs were able to take place earlier today.  After two long weeks of races, congratulate any Sugarloaf staff you see for making the one of a kind event such a success.  Find the link below to see times, details and winners of today’s or races or any of the races from Nationals or the NorAms.</p>
<p>In snow, the Carrabassett Cream got nice and soft today without really getting wet or sticky.  Temperature inversion was also taking place so it felt almost as warm at the top of Skyline as it did at the base.  It’s for these reasons that a very beautiful afternoon of spring skiing took place.  Safe to say my favorite runs during March have been carving and cruising down Spillway and Haulback.</p>
<p>Tonight were looking at another warm one with temps staying in the 30’s overnight on hill.  We also expect a bit of rain that some of us got a taste of today.  Due to said weather, the grooming team will send out a minimal shift to hit just the main stuff under the lifts.  Timberline is scheduled to run tomorrow along with King Pine and Whiffletree at 9:00am, preceded by SuperQuad, Skyline, Snubber, Skidway and DRC East at 8:30am.</p>
<p>Looking ahead 48 hours we will have received something like 1-2 inches of precipitation.  Fortunately, the hours within that period where it is forecasted to precipitate the hardest are also when it will be the coldest – later on in the day tomorrow and into tomorrow night.  Point being; don’t be discouraged if you wake up to some wetness tomorrow because there should be snow behind it.  We’ll keep you posted on the forecast details in the meantime.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
