<p>Hey there Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The Friday-feeling is contagious here at Sugarloaf as we prepare to kick off the last weekend of the 2021/22 winter season. Thanks to a quick visit from Old Man Winter that dropped a few inches of fresh snow yesterday, the skiing and riding is incredible right now. If you didn’t know any better, the conditions could easily be confused for mid-winter rather than late-spring. And in true New England fashion, we’ll get a good taste of both winter and spring this weekend, with forecasts calling for cooler, wintery temperatures on Saturday, followed by warm, spring-like conditions for out last day on Sunday.</p>
<p>The new snow has groomed in nicely, but there are still a few pockets of natural sluff on the sides of ungroomed trails, prime for slashing. The cats will be out again this evening, laying fresh stripes on a larger selection of trails including Tote Road, Comp Hill, Narrow Gauge, Spillway and Sluice.</p>
<p>Now that we're deep into the spring skiing season, you should expect surfaces to be pretty firm in the mornings, before they loosen up later in the day as temps rise. These freeze thaw cycles make for great corn snow, but they also mean that you may find some trails roped off in the mornings until snow softens enough for Ski Patrol to open them up. During this time of year, the open trail count you see on this report is a reflection of the trails we expect to open at some point during the day, once surfaces soften.</p>
<p>We’ll have the same two-late season lifts – SuperQuad and Skyline – spinning tomorrow at 8:30am.</p>
<p>Happy Trails<br/>Noelle</p>
