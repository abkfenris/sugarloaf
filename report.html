<p>Happy St. Patrick’s Day,</p>
<p>The spring vibes will continue here at Sugarloaf today with another blissful day of sun, soft snow, and friends. If you are riding solo today ride with others, make conversation and maybe you’ll find a new friend. You just never know who you might sit next to on a chairlift at Sugarloaf.</p>
<p>The grooming department hit the hill last night and covered trails all the way from Timberline off the summit to Haulback over in the King Pine Bowl. The corn cycle continues with colder temperatures at night and warm temperatures during the day. Don’t forget to bring your skis into Down Hill Supply Company to get that warm weather wax to keep you slip-sliding along the flats and cross-cuts while your buddies scuttle along with powerful pole plants.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for sun, warm temperatures, and moderate winds. Temps range to a high of 50 degrees today at the base while the summit sits in the upper 30s. Winds are moderate from the W at 25-35mph. Skies will start foggy with the sun prevailing for most of the day. Live it up the spring weather today because it looks like winter is comin’ a knockin’ this weekend.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
