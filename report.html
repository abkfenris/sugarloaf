<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>I’m wondering how many people showed up to the hil completely overdressed for today, I know I did. This little teaser of spring will be short-lived so enjoy it today while you can. We have a festive night on tap for all tonight with several performances. Things kick off with a live performance from Don Rogers from 3-5 pm at 45 North. Then the Jason Spooner Trio hits the stage at 8 pm opening for The Ghost of Paul Revere.</p>
<p>While ya’ll out partying, recuperating, or losing money to your friends in a poker game. The grooming team will hit the hill and smooth out all that terrain that got chewed up today. It is definitely a good afternoon to bring your mountain ride into the shop tonight for a fresh tune on your edges.</p>
<p>Tonight’s temps cool down significantly as we head into Sunday. Lows around the base tonight will be in the low teens, while the summit drops to around zero. These temps persist into Sunday where we will see mostly sunny skies and a high around 15 degrees at the base. Winds remain in the standard range of 20-40mph from the NW. Sunday night brings even colder temps leading into the first part of the week. Then things warm again mid-week with a possible storm leading into next weekend.</p>
<p>Have a fun night,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
