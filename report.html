<p style="text-align: justify;">Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hope you’ve enjoyed your Tuesday turns—I know I did! And what’s not to like about sunny bluebird skies?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our snowmaking systems went back online this morning as our tireless team once again got the guns going on The Birches and Hayburner, blasting both into a world of white, while beginning work on Windrow. At this point in the season, expanding terrain is the name of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We should see temperatures continue to cool into evening, with the summit reaching single-digits overnight as our groomers get to work. For those heading to the hill tomorrow, you can catch first chair on Skidway, Skyline, or the SuperQuad at 8:30am, providing access to our 18 open trails; dress for teens at the top with low 20s by the base. A weak shortwave will join a coastal low, bringing snow showers to our slopes during the day on Wednesday and possibly into Thursday.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking ahead, a warm front arrives just in time for the weekend with the promise of light mixed precipitation—though, as I like to say, it’s never too soon to start snow dancing to see if we can swing this front in our favor!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking of this weekend, join us for the annual <a href="/events-calendar/tree-lighting-festival" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tree Lighting Festival &amp; Fireworks</a> on Saturday, December 11. Do some shopping and support local vendors at the <a href="/events-calendar" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Holiday Gift Bazaar</a> in the Sugarloaf Mountain Hotel; in the spirit of the season, there will be a collection table for any food or toys to be donated to the United Methodist Economic Ministry. Embark on a horse and carriage ride down Main Street Sugarloaf, enjoy festive music on the Beach, entertainment by AudioBody, and even see Santa—that’s right, Santa Claus is coming to town! He’ll be accompanied by Amos and friends to spread holiday cheer. End the afternoon with a fireworks display for Santa’s sendoff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Something else to celebrate on Saturday, December 11: <a href="/dining/bullwinkles" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bullwinkle’s Bistro</a> will be reopening with an all-new menu for the ’21/22 season! Don’t worry, you can still order their famous Bloodies.</p>
<p>Signing off to Snow Reporter Chris,</p>
<p>Gabrielle</p>
