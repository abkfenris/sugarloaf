<p>Good afternoon snow riders,</p>
<p>Mother Nature continues to deliver the goods with cold temps, sunny skies, and soft skiing. With the sun now hitting the trails for a majority of the day, the spring vibes just can’t be helped. Don’t forget<a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/events-calendar"> The Mallet Brothers Band</a> is hitting the stage in the King Pine room Saturday night, so bring your dancing shoes with you this weekend.</p>
<p> Today marked the start of the 10<sup>th</sup> <a href="https://winterkids.org/downhill-24/.xml">Winter Kids Downhill</a> 24 event. The Downhill 24 requires teams to constantly be present and skiing on the hill for 24 hours. If you look at the mountain tonight you’ll see lights coming down Lower Narrow Gauge. So when you’re all tucked in and warm tonight think of the children and adults alike skiing through the cold dark night to raise money to get Maine kids outside during the winter.</p>
<p>Tonight the grooming department will hit the hill and groom everything on the mountain plus a few oddities which are always nice to enjoy. Patrol has poked around the mountain and have opened up all glades except Brackett Basin and Burnt Mountain. As always ski in control in the woods because you never know when a pongee or downed log might present itself to you.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for temps in the single digits, clear skies, and moderate winds. Saturday brings us partial sun in the morning, then clouds start to filter in for the afternoon. Temps warm significantly to the mid-to-upper 20s during the day. Winds remain moderate in the 25-45mph range. Which should allow for full lift operations tomorrow.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
