<p><strong>Double Runner East and Skidway open. Skyline and SuperQuad remain on windhold. -10:21am</strong></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wild weather continues on here at Sugarloaf. The precipitation has stopped while the winds of have continued throughout the morning. It’s looking to be a slow start today due to weather, so grab your favorite morning beverage, find your favorite Sunday cartoons, and kick back: today is a good day to take your time heading to the hill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our grooming team had a late start due to temperatures; they've only just gotten on the hill early this morning. After big saturation events, it’s best for the longevity of the snow, and the overall product, to wait, let things cool, and let that saturation percolate downhill. Currently, snow cats are working to get terrain serviced by Double Runner West groomed out first, then they'll head towards the upper mountain to get terrain squared away serviced by the SuperQuad if winds will allow.</p>
<p>Sunday is shaping out to be a great day... if you’re a kite enthusiast. When you venture out, expect relatively warm temps around 34 degrees at the base. The winds are strong out of the west with gusts up to 70mph at the summit. The sky should reveal some sun today as clouds rip by. Things look to remain windy and cloudy into tonight with temperatures dropping to the below freezing mark.</p>
<p>Due to winds and current snow conditions, sliers and riders should take into consideration that terrain and lift delays are inevitable and most certainly a reality today. Our Mountain Ops team is working efficiently to get us safely shredding on as much as the mountain as possible. Stayed tuned to <a href="twitter.com/sugarloafsnow">@SugarloafSnow </a>on Twitter and here at the Mountain Report for the latest.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
