<p><strong>UPDATE: Whiffletree, King Pine, West Mountain on grooming hold.</strong></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Get your puffy on and sharpen up your edges because today is going to be chilly and the conditions sporty and fast. Last night temperatures sank into the single digits taking our highly saturated snowpack and condensing it to a surface where even ski racers might find it to be too <em>hard to handle.</em> But <em>don’t you cry, and dry your eyes on the wind </em>because we have a wonderful sunny day on our hands</p>
<p>Currently, the grooming team is working diligently to bring us as much terrain as possible for today. We are going to see limited terrain open today with the overnight freeze so make sure you check below for a detailed list of what is open and groomed, all-natural snow and non-groomed trails will likely remain closed today. The terrain park crew was at it as well last night reworking terrain park features. Today you’ll have Boardwalk, Stomping Grounds, and Dropline to practice all your favorite tricks. The 6:15am report from the top of Skyline from was temps -5, winds 15-25mph, and Skyline is clear to open.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for continued cold temperatures in the single digits and low teens, with winds 35-55mph on the upper mountain. Clear skies will dominate today, so <em>why hold out for more, here comes sunshine.</em> Tonight temperatures drop down to around 0 while winds diminish. Friday will help us <em>sit plush with a royal flush</em> as snow arrives around 7 am and continues throughout the day and into the evening where people will be <em>dancing in the streets </em>as we kick off our<a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/events-calendar/fire-on-the-mountain?fbclid=IwAR3JuKtK-Wy30FV7thOM8WrWtKGeUaA330uwcY_pHP9peKEQE9_Uayr6HQk"> Fire on the Mountain</a> weekend, with live performances kicking off with the Skull &amp; Roses for après’ in the Widowmaker. With The Maine Dead Project headlining the night in the King Pine Room. If you have never considered yourself a fan of the Grateful Dead but haven’t really given them a proper chance, come on down check out some of the shows and see for yourself what the <em>Ship of Fools</em> is all about.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
