<p style="text-align: justify;">Good Monday morning, Sugarloaf skiers and riders!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the weekend, Old Man Winter made quite the comeback to Carrabassett, bringing with him a storm that accumulated 8 inches of fresh snow to our slopes; as a result, the mountain is in the best shape of the season (so far!) and current terrain offerings include 93 open trails—that’s almost 500 open, explorable acres—plus a handful of glades as well as 5 terrain parks to play in, including the latest addition Sidewinder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our tireless team of Sugarloaf snowmakers continue onward in the march of expansion, getting the guns going yesterday afternoon on Drop Line and Sluice Headwall; their work there continued overnight, with additional snow starting to blow on Wedge late Sunday afternoon. Meanwhile, the grooming department headed out in full force in two shifts, starting with lower mountain terrain and working their way up through second shift as the winds diminished. All that fresh snow from Saturday’s storm is sure to create delicious, hot-off-the-press cord for our early birds who make it up to the mountain for first turns today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The forecast calls for calm conditions today with temperatures on the milder side of seasonal; dress for a range of 15 to 19 degrees by the base with single digits at the summit. Weather-wise, we expect to see cloud cover increase throughout the day with a chance of afternoon snow showers; as for winds, higher elevation terrain will experience gusts up to 40 miles per hour from the West, though most of the mountain will see sustained winds between 8 to 14 miles per hour—what better weather to take advantage of post-storm leftovers?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking ahead, Tuesday will be a continuation of calm winds paired with sunny skies and warming temperatures. All in all, it’s shaping up to be a great week to getaway to the mountains of Western Maine; come spend some quality time outside with family and friends, or solo, on our slopes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And hey, happy last day of January, everybody—1 month of 2022 down, 11 to go!
