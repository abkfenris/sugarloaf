<p style="text-align: justify;">Good morning, Sugarloafers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wow, how about that moon last night and this morning? Just incredible! Hope everyone got to enjoy it, because the final full moon of 2021 is going to be obscured by a multitude of perfectly symmetrical pieces of fine art falling from the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our grooming team was hard at work last night, chopping and grinding away at the result of Mother Nature’s temper over the last week. On the positive side, they <em>have</em> been doing it for years and are going to have all 148 acres of available terrain canvased with corduroy for our enjoyment today. The snowmaking crew was quick on the draw and fired up operations on Boardwalk, Skidder, and Whiffletree; they will continue working into today for as long as they can. Eventually, with our incoming storm, the winds are going to switch to an unfavorable direction for Skidder and Boardwalk, which will most likely need to be shut down. Whiffletree, however, has hydrants on the East Side and so they will hopefully be able to continue through the storm.</p>
<p>Today, expect things to feel nippy this morning with temps around 20 degrees, gradually making it to the mid 20’s by afternoon. Winds have calmed down for now but are expected to rise again today only to the 10-30mph range, which will feel like a pleasant breeze compared to yesterday. Snow will begin falling right around last chair today, and will be heaviest between 8:00pm and midnight tonight, so plan for a snowy ramble as you go about your Saturday night delights. By tomorrow morning we are looking to have 5-8 inches of beauty to revel in for the soon-to-be best Sunday shred session of the '21-22 ski season.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Join us this evening for our annual <a href="/events-calendar/tree-lighting-festival" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tree Lighting Festival</a>—and Santa Claus will be coming to town, accompanied by Amos and friends! Come celebrate the season in Sugarloaf style with warm treats, music on the Beach, fireworks, and more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Catch you here in the afternoon,</span></p>
