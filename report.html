<p>It's a cloudier but warmer start to the day here at Sugarloaf this morning, and it's shaping up to be a pretty comfortable Sunday up on the mountain. If you're headed our way today expect temps in the in the low to mid-20s, with a chance for some light snow showers throughout the day, and plenty of fresh corduroy awaiting your turns. </p>
<p>Groomers had a busy and productive night on the mountain last night, hitting most of the usual suspects, including Windrow in the West Mountain area and the newly opened Haulback over in the King Pine Bowl. Snowmakers kept at it through the night last night on West Mountain, Scoot, and Sidewinder, and will be shutting things down during the day today. </p>
<p>We have 11 lifts scheduled to spin for you again today, including Timberline and King Pine. SuperQuad and Skyline will open at 7:30am for our <a href="/passholder-hub/first-tracks">First Tracks pass holders</a> as usual. Winds are calm here at the base this morning but groomers are reporting that they're pretty blustery at higher elevations, which could impact some of our upper mountain lifts. Our lift mechanics are up checking things out as we speak, so be sure to check back here regulary throughout the morning for any updates, and follow our <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sugarloafsnow" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Mtn Ops Twitter Feed">mountain operations feed on Twitter right here</a>. </p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
