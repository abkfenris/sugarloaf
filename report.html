<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Jah's light certainly seems to being shining upon us today. I was pleasantly surprised to see the stars twinkling and the sunrise blazing this morning. Now it appears entirely possible that Mother Nature is just toying with our hearts and emotions. So grab your best pal, your dreadie hat, and all your favorite Reggae Fest goodies because it’s time to pick yourself up, dust yourself, and start all over again.</p>
<p>The grooming team is at it this morning doing everything they can to buff out as much terrain as possible. If all goes according to plan there’ll be groomed snow riding from West Mountain to to King Pine today. Temperatures dropped to around freezing at the base last night firming everything up. With a continued stroke of luck, the sun will stay out and quickly heat things up and will possibly grant us another day’s corn harvest.</p>
<p>The weather forecast today contradicts the current window forecast. Currently bluebird skies abound with temps just above freezing at the base. This afternoon we’re looking at a second round of light precipitation to move into the area. Winds are forecasted with gusts to 35mph at the summit today which isn’t strong enough to effect lift operations. High temperatures will reach almost 50 degrees today at the base.</p>
<p>Party on rockers,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
