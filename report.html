<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed today as much as I did.  For all the bitter cold in the air, there was a tender softness to the corduroy out there this morning and the blowing snow on Tote Road this afternoon.  Granted you had all your skin covered it was an awesome and really beautiful day to be out there.</p>
<p>Snowmaking was back online today after a decent hiatus blowing Tote Road top to bottom as well as White Nitro and Gondi Extensions.  They plan to continue operations tonight as the temperatures are going to drop into the negatives on the hill.  Grooming tonight will be including Spillway and Widowmaker into their weekday route.  Lifts tomorrow will be consistent with the rest of the week. </p>
<p>Weather tomorrow shows increasing temperatures up into the 20’s with wind speeds as high as 45-60mph at the top and cloud cover expected.  Later in the week we will see temperatures potentially in the upper 40’s accompanied by a mix of rain and snow.</p>
<p>The forecast is bound to change but we are definitely in for some heat and some sort of weather this week so stay tuned and we’ll keep you posted on all the updates.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful evening,</p>
<p>Brady   </p>
