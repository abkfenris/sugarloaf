<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>These are the days that truly demonstrate why Sugarloaf is the King of Spring. Although it was a little chilly at the start, it definitely led to some prime-time corn conditions this afternoon. With Mother Nature hitting the reset button for tomorrow you can be sure the spring vibes will continue at the King of Spring.</p>
<p>The grooming team tonight will hit a variety of terrain for the Sunday fun day shred fest. You can expect a few trails from the top of each lift with the possibility of a few more being thrown in there. Tomorrow we’ll continue our <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/spring-operations-schedule">spring lift operations</a> with Skyline, SuperQuad, and Double Runner.</p>
<p>Now that we're deep into the spring skiing season, you should expect surfaces to be pretty firm in the mornings, before they loosen up later in the day as temps rise. These freeze that cycles make for great corn snow, but they also mean that you may find some trails roped off in the mornings until snow softens enough for Ski Patrol to open them up. During this time of year, the open trail count you see on this report is a reflection of the trails we expect to open at some point during the day, once surfaces soften. </p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for increasing clouds and temperatures dropping to around freezing. Tomorrow warms up quicker than today as temps hit a high in the low 50s around the base for Sunday. A few clouds will be around but expect mostly sunny skies with winds chillin’ in the 20-30mph range.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
