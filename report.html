<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Today was awesome.  Seemed like the groomers were able to really get to a lot last night as there was a plethora of amazing corduroy to take advantage of at first tracks this morning.  The sun came out earlier than expected and stayed out all day.  It’s hard not to be romantic about skiing but I feel my love for this mountain reinvigorated every time I go out there.</p>
<p>Reggae Fest approaches in only a few short days.  It therefore will be plugged here up until it happens.  Get pumped for what should be the best Reggae in recent years.  We look forward to performances Thursday thru Sunday from The Big Takeover, Joint Operation, The Equalites, Soul Rebel Project, Gorilla Finger Dub, Zeme Libre, Catchavibe, Higher Education, Green Lion Crew and DJ 4eign. </p>
<p>Tonight into tomorrow weather will be mostly the same.  Dropping into the twenties tonight on hill but will stay pretty warm overnight.  Tomorrow we are looking at 41-45 at the base and 28-32 at the top.  Partial cloud cover expected and slightly less wind in the forecast as well.</p>
<p>Groomers will hit the hill tonight and get everything they did last night, all of which skied like a dream today.  They’re also going to try to get to Lower Gondi and Ramdown thru Slasher.  Same 5 lifts tomorrow with SuperQuad, Skyline, Snubber, Skidway and DRC East all running from 8:30am on.  I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention today as one of my all-time favorite park days at the Loaf so if tomorrow is anything like today I will see you either at the Spruline pipe or the jumps in Stomping Grounds.</p>
<p>Extended forecast shows the peak of warmth this week on Wednesday with the temps getting into the 40’s.  Besides that we will be in the 20’s and 30’s all week.  A precipitation system appears to moving in and will likely hit us Thursday-Saturday.  Let’s pray for a snowy Reggae!  More details to come so stay tuned to future reports.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
