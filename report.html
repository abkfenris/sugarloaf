<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The last few days have been a little tough here weather-wise but things are coming around nicely. With snow squalls dropping around an inch of snow yesterday and our dedicated grooming fleet hard at work, we should see some great skiing along with a sunny day. With winds still in the strong category. It is likely we will again see our lift operations affected.</p>
<p>The grooming team hit the hill last night and was able to cover all of our on-piste terrain last night. They did avoid a few trails that were receiving some resurfacing love from our snowmaking team. Kings Landing, Hayburner, Candyside, Bridal Chain, Tote Road, and Lower Timberline all were hit overnight. Currently, they are shutting down Tote, Bridal, and Timberline, and will be making the move over to Sluice first thing this morning. With cold temps during production last night you should find some soft velvety turns on these trails today.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for temps in the mid-teens with clear and sunny skies. Winds have switched around to the NW overnight and are still strong on the upper mountain with speeds in the 40-60mph range. Tonight sees temps holding in the teens while the winds continue in the 50-70mph on the summit. Tomorrow brings warm pleasant temperatures in the upper 20s and low 30s.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
