<p>Good afternoon reggae rockers,</p>
<p>The corn harvest is on today with soft and fast snow surfaces across the whole mountain. Snow riding from West Mountain to Haulback delivered the goods you’d expect at a reggae fest. I sure am grateful for our weather today and especially to just be back celebrating spring vibes and Reggae Fest with all of you lions out there today.</p>
<p>The grooming team will again be hitting the hill tonight aiming to groom a trail or two off of each lift for tomorrow’s journey up the Quad and to Bullwinkles. While partying out there today always remember to look out for one another and ski in control despite what the colors are telling you. A real vibe crusher is having to take a trip to Farmington or even worse making someone else have to take the trip to Farmington. Do your part and be a part of this whole.</p>
<p>The weather this afternoon calls for the return to rain/snow showers but by this time you’ll hopefully participated in enough antics that you can go on unaffected. Temperatures drop during the overnight hours with highs being right around freezing at the base. Sunday brings us a cooler day as the previous night’s storm moves away from the area. Temperatures tomorrow remain cool with highs reaching 40 around the base while the summit stays below freezing. Monday is looking to be a warm and sunny day with stronger winds.</p>
<p>Fire burn,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
