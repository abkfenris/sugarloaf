<p>Good morning snow riders,</p>
<p>Here we are Sugarloafers heading into another weekend of spring skiing delights. With still plenty of snow to go around for everyone, you can be sure the party is just going to keep going here at the King of Spring.</p>
<p>The grooming team this morning is settin ya’ll up with that fine quality corduroy you become so accustomed to as Sugarloafers. You can enjoy such smoothness down Sluice Headwalll, Sluice, Spillway, Hayburner, and Tote Road. The lift department has 3 lifts scheduled for today Skyline, Double Runner, and SuperQuad. Reports are coming in with moderate winds and all lifts are looking good to go at this time.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for cloudy skies with a chance of here and there drizzles that could come In many forms. Temperatures are pleasant in the mid 30’s up high and mid 40’s around the base. Winds are forecasted at speeds of 30-40mph with gusts to 55mph at the summit. Tonight, strong winds clear out today’s moisture and sets us up for a clear, sunny, and beautiful weekend of spring skiing.</p>
<p>Stay Tuned,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
