<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The corn harvest is on at the loaf, and early birds were treated to some fantastic corny corduroy conditions across the whole mountain. With the sun shining and the spring vibes flowing it’s time to push past any lethargy from the week and make hay while the sun shines.</p>
<p>The grooming team tonight will again hit the hill in force to groom out all of our on-piste terrain from Timberline all the way over to Haulback. Tomorrow Narrow Gauge will host the women’s Giant Slalom set to start at 10 AM. There are many places to view these top-level competitors push the limits on Narrow Gauge. You can venture down Upper Comp Hill a few hundred feet and cut over to right to the fence line at Narrow Gauge, or to see the lower part of the course continue down to Tote Cross Cut skier’s right. Another great place to scope these Athletes is from the T-Bar Load area, or down at the Jean Luce building at the finish on Peavey Cross Cut.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for cooling temperatures and moderate winds. Clouds move in overnight to give us cloudy skies and a chance of snow showers for Sunday where high temperatures will reach the upper 30s at the base. Winds tomorrow remain in the moderate range of 20-35mph, which should allow for full lift operations tomorrow. Things cool off significantly Sunday night into Monday where we’ll see more chances of snow showers and high temperatures reaching the mid-20s at the base and low teens up top. The first part of this week brings cold temps, clear skies, and great conditions for the US Alpine races to come.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
