<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The winds have calmed, the skies have cleared, and the snow remains cold as we head into the 7<sup>th</sup> inning stretch of March. Today should make for exceptional race and recreational snow riding today, but definitely take advantage of it today because we got another long-duration weather event set up to affect us starting tomorrow through the weekend.</p>
<p>The grooming team last night went at it and groomed a significant portion of our snowmaking terrain. You’ll find fresh corduroy this morning from Timberline all the way over to Haulback for your carving pleasures. We’d also like to welcome White Nitro from Spillway cross-cut back into the rotation fresh off the disabled list.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for mostly sunny skies with a few passing clouds. Temperatures are mild in the upper twenties up top and reaching a high in the mid-30s around the base. Winds have subsided to the 20-35mph range from the North, which should allow for full lift operations today. Tonight temperatures cool back down below freezing at the base. The winds switch around to the SE in the 20-35mph as this week’s storm bears down on us. Tomorrow looks good for snow with 2-4 inches possible throughout the day. Sometime Thursday night warm air will come into the game and give us some light mixed precipitation, with another 2-4 inches expected overnight. Light mixed precipitation and snow continue on Friday as the system persists through the weekend with the next chance of sun on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
