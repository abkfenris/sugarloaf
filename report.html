<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The spring corn harvest continues on today with cold weather overnight and another warm and sun basked day at The Loaf. Make sure to grab an old pal, sun glasses, sunscreen, and a credit card to lifestyle with and enjoy some real relaxation on the Bullwinkles porch with just you, a cocktail, the sun, and the western Maine Mountains.</p>
<p>The grooming team last night took on a respectable list with cool temperatures to assist and creating a world class ski surface for our Maine Day enjoyment. Today you’ll find groomed trails from Windrow to Widowmaker. Also today you can find finely buffed steeps on Skidder and White Nitro. I always enjoy the spring time skiing seeking and timing out the perfect corn run, to find that perfect balance between firm and soft, fast and sticky, but alas “It’s not about perfection; it’s about the joy of striving.” –Thomas Keller. So enjoy the hunt today!</p>
<p>The weather today calls for true spring bliss. Temps remain warm with a high of around 50 degrees at the base. Winds are calm, gusting to only 15mph at the summit, while the skies will start and stay clear throughout the day. Live it up and take it in today because we are in for another roller coaster of weather coming up in the latter half of the week and into the weekend, more on that this afternoon.  </p>
<p>Live it up,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
