<p><b>8:47AM UPDATE: Double Runner East, Skidway and Sawdusater on wind hold . SuperQuad and Skyline on weather/conditions closure for the day. </b></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Thank Jerry it’s Friday. With a week of wild weather trying to wrap up, and the imminent arrival of Old Man Winter and Father Christmas, there hasn’t been a better Friday to put away the bah humbug, grab your Santa hat, and a nice rich Eggnog and allow yourself to feel the holiday spirit.</p>
<p>Due to warm temperatures, substantial saturation of our snowpack, and the quick arrival of cool air, the grooming squad has opted to stay off most terrain. If they do press and squeeze it all down, when the cold air arrives you can bet ice skates will be a better option than a snowboard. Therefore only Tote Road, The Landing, Bridal Chain, and Lower Timeberline have been groomed out early this morning.  Snowmakers have also been enjoying another night off from production. However after this weekend’s storm blows away, we are looking at a lot of temperatures in the teens and single digits, and our snowmakers will once again plug away at the massive job of covering all our trails will snow to ski on.</p>
<p>As I said the wild weather is trying to wrap up here in Carrabassett but sometimes you just get kicked while you’re down. As cold air arrives the winds have ramped up significantly which are more than likely to affect lift operations today. Otherwise expect temps in the upper 30s and mostly cloudy skies. Temps are going to consistently drop throughout the day eventually getting down to the teens tonight. Make sure to check back here on the mountain report or<a href="@sugarloafsnow"> @sugarloafsnow</a> on Twitter for all the most recent terrain and lift updates.</p>
