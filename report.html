<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Time ceased to exist last week as every single day we had incredibly warm weather and perfectly soft slushy laps.  I would say spring break for college kids was a success as the park rats were lapping in bigger numbers than I’ve seen all year.</p>
<p>Warm and windy again this morning as we predict midday will be about 35 degrees at base, 22 at top.  Wind will play it’s oh so familiar role of coming up the Western face of the mountain as fast as 55 mph -- Already getting word that Skyline and Timberline will start the day on wind hold.  It shall be a warm windy cloudy day.</p>
<p>Since it’s staying warm, this rain hasn’t hurt our trail totals yet and there’s still plenty to shred around the mountain.  Still close to 100 trails and still a lot of snow to push around.  For lifts today we have 7 scheduled which include Snubber, DoubleRunner East, Superquad, Skyline, and Skidway at 8:30am, King Pine and Whiffletree at 9:00am.  No Timberline today.  Our Boardwalk Park is now taken down but Stomping Grounds has been amazing lately and Dropline is still feeling super fresh for those sending big.</p>
<p>Groomers did what they could last night while sticking with the minimalist strategy allowed by such moisture.  Expect a few trails to be groomed off each lift until temperatures drop back down to a range that allows the crew to be out in full force (hopefully tonight).</p>
<p>Extended forecast shows tomorrow as the coldest day of the week.  Temperatures will rise back up to above thirty Wednesday and hover there through the week.  Precipitation possible Wednesday night through Thursday night which will likely be some snow some mix.</p>
<p>Have a blast on the hill today.  See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
