<p style="text-align: justify;"> Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While our snowmakers are enjoying ideal conditions for snow production, the rest of us will walk outside first thing this morning and exclaim something like, “<em>brrrrr</em>” However, the sun will be shining, the winds benign, and the trail conditions sporty and fast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Mountain Operations team was busy last night getting everything groomed and laying out new snow to expand our terrain offerings. The groomers went out on the hill and groomed all open terrain except for Sluice and Skidder. The snowmakers embraced the cold and got guns crankin' on Haulback and Stomping Grounds. Also, they got additional equipment running to put the finishing touches on Cruiser and Haywire. The park crew is drawing up plans for your jibbing delights as the snow continues to pile up in Stomping Grounds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather today calls for sun, temperatures in the low teens, and calm winds around 10mph. If you venture to the summit of Sugarloaf today, you’ll experience increased winds between 20-30mph and temps around 3 degrees. Cold temps will persist into tonight, dropping below zero at the summit. Remember while riding today go with the flow, stay in control, and to look at your buddy’s shnauz once in a while.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have a great day,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris</p>
