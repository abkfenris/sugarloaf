<p><strong>UPDATE: Skyline on wind hold, SuperQuad on ice hold. Starting lifts will be DRC Long to T-Bar. -8:05am</strong></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The grooming team is reporting around 3 inches of total snowfall on the upper mountain with most of the snow falling above Peavey Cross Cut. This puts us at a season total of 100 inches on the year. With a substantial amount of rain falling before it changed over to snow it is likely the mountain is experiencing a diverse selection of surface types that would best be described as variable.</p>
<p>The grooming team hit a limited selection of trails due to rain and warm temps for much of the night. Today you’ll find corduroy on Tote Road, Candyside, Spurline, and Lower Gauge. Patrol is getting out on the hill first thing and has some decisions to make. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a decent amount of terrain on a conditions closure, nor would I be surprised if everything stayed open and snow riders could enjoy some late season wet snow riding.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for cloudy skies with the chance of rain/snow showers throughout the day. Winds are blustery with speeds 35-45mph with gusts going to 55mph at the summit. I would not be surprised to see a wind hold this morning. Temps remain on the colder side with high temperatures at the base reaching the mid-30s. This weather pattern continues to hold through Friday where we’ll see on and off rain/snow showers before things start to clear out Saturday night. Our closing day on Sunday looks to be almost perfect with sunny skies, calm winds, and temperatures in the mid-to-upper 40s.</p>
<p>Now that we're deep into the spring skiing season, you should expect surfaces to be pretty firm in the mornings, before they loosen up later in the day as temps rise. These freeze thaw cycles make for great corn snow, but they also mean that you may find some trails roped off in the mornings until snow softens enough for Ski Patrol to open them up. During this time of year, the open trail count you see on this report is a reflection of the trails we expect to open at some point during the day, once surfaces soften.</p>
<p>Happy Trails,<br/>Chris</p>
