<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The warm temperatures and sun from yesterday and today have changed the conditions on and off-trail. The snow is thicker and denser than previously due to melting that occurred during the last 36 hours. Not to worry though because when things do get cold again that thick snow will solidify and create a bomb-proof layer between the surface of the snow and the ground. Keeping all those fallen logs and stumps in the glades well covered, and also allowing the on-piste to remain smoother throughout the day and not get so chunky.</p>
<p>Tonight the grooming department is going to hit the hill and cover all of the usual suspects with Zen gardens of corduroy. The snowmaking department still remains in limbo as to when they are going to make their return to finish their last trails on the summit. The park crew is testing out their most recent terrain park in Drop Line where they have created a large big air style jump. The park is slated to be opened this coming Saturday.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for falling temperatures to the teens around the base with calm winds. Tomorrow brings a wonderful sunny day with comfortable temperatures in the mid-to-upper 20’s. Winds remain moderate in the 20-40mph range. Saturday is looking to be the official end of the most epic run of cold air and soft snow we’ve seen in recent years with warm temperatures and a chance of rain and snow showers. Looking down the road it appears the next chance for a large-scale system is late next week. The snow gods have noticed our reduced snow dancing and sacrifices and are responding accordingly.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
