<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<div><span>The crescent moon shown bright and the stars twinkle brightly showing us the light they propelled towards us thousands of years ago. When these stars burned and sent out the light that I saw this morning towards Earth, the Mesopotamia culture was in full swing of the Bronze Age, the base of written language and mathematics as we know it was being developed and recorded for the very first time. The wheel, sailboats, and complex hydrology were all being invented and created. For the above statements are true, it’s a sure sign to once again grab your sunglasses, chap-stick, and your best pal and make for glorious day of sunny skiing at the Loaf.</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>Last night our snow cats covered all of our open terrain and buttered out those soft moguls left by yesterdays’ storm. Early bird will indeed get the worm this morning. Our snowmaking crew was at it again last night tackling the darkness and generally rugged nature of Sugarloaf at night to keep our guns running on Narrow Gauge starting at pick pole and running all the way through Lower Narrow Gauge. They will continue hammering this former World Cup downhill trail through out today.</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>Today anticipate temps in the teens this morning, then gradually rising with the sun to the mid-twenties. Winds will be diminishing. We are looking at a great day to relish in the last day of the weekend, and to put off our duties and deliberations that will need to take place in the coming week. For we have come a long way since Ancient Mesopotamia.</span></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Please note that uphill traffic is limited to the time window of 7:00am to 8:30AM</strong></p>
