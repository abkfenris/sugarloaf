<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Well if you haven’t heard the term sleeper day, and you skied today you just experienced it, if you weren’t able to ski today, I’m deeply sorry. Perfect bluebird skies, calm winds, and a few inches of fresh snow overnight led to one of those days where you could feel like you are right where you’re supposed to be.</p>
<p>The grooming team tonight will again hit the hill and spread their love all over the mountain and set us up for another awesome day of skiing and riding tomorrow. Patrol has been poking around the mountain here and there to open terrain back up that was forced to close due to the thaw freeze cycles we saw at the end of February. With another inch or two forecasted tonight, they might have their sights on more terrain heading into the weekend.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for dropping temps and another clipper-style storm to cruise over the region. The possibility of another inch or two of snow tonight and tomorrow morning is indeed exciting considering the marvelous conditions folks experienced today. Tomorrow looks mostly cloudy with possible snow showers. Temps remain cold with highs at the base in the upper teens. Winds appear to pick up tomorrow to the 30-55mph range. If this forecast pans out we may see some wind holds tomorrow.</p>
<p>As the Fire on the Mountain festival fades from the rearview, we can look forward to the party continuing this Saturday with a live performance in the King Pine room from Maines’s very own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/themallettbrothersband">Mallet Brothers Band</a>. Tickets and more info can be found <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mallett-brothers-with-elec-tickets-229861711567">here.</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
