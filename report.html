<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Those who battled the wind and endured the burn of the T-Bar were treated to some stellar snow riding conditions this morning. Strong prevailing winds dominated the weather today. But after all, these are the days where we all earn the coveted title as “Sugarloafers”. Just out there getting after with big smiles despite what Mother Nature throws at us.</p>
<p>The grooming department tonight will again hit the hill in their tireless journey of manicuring our ski trails. All this fresh snow and coldish temperatures in the near future will allow conditions to maintain a high level as all the drifts and powder get turned into that smooth crisp corduroy that gets you out of bed at 7 am on a Sunday. Today Ski Patrol was able to drop quite a few ropes across the mountain adding 16 new trails and 43 additional acres of terrain for skiing and riding.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls diminishing winds and cold temps. Winds will die off overnight leaving us with moderate winds for Monday with speeds 20-40mph. Tomorrow things warm slightly to highs just above freezing at the base while the upper mountain remains in the low 20s, expect a mostly cloudy day with a few pockets of sun. The week ahead looks relatively quiet storm-wise while the prime maple syrup weather cycle returns with temps above freezing during the day then dropping again below freezing at night. A storm or two is possible late next week but is too far out to think about it now.  Hope everyone had a great weekend here at Sugarloaf and we’ll catch you here at the Mountain Report next time.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
