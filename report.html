<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The last couple of days at Sugarloaf definitely have been ones for the books of 2022. Since it’s only February 6th 2022 for only one day ever. It’s time to fight the body aches that have grown over the last couple of days and head out to enjoy another wonderful day of snow riding in the Maine mountains.</p>
<p>The grooming department had a very busy schedule last night and are currently working diligently to bring us as much groomed terrain as possible. With heaps of new soft snow, grooming trails can be more time-consuming and difficult because if you’re not careful your machine can quickly become an auger with vertical momentum instead of horizontal. The Ski Patrol has been poking around into every nook and cranny of Sugarloaf and opening as much terrain as possible including obscure gladed terrain such as Boom Scooter. Have you heard of Boom Scooter or even know where it is? If not see if you can find it today and I’ll meet you there.</p>
<p>Things are pretty cold this morning judging by the protesting of my clutch. However, things are supposed to warm up nicely. It may take a little time but eventually, we’ll see temperatures reach around 15 degrees at the base while remaining in the single digits at the summit. Winds are forecasted 5mph stronger than yesterday with speeds reaching around 45mph on the upper mountain. On the contrary to reports yesterday it appears we are in for another freshen up of snow Monday night into Tuesday. More on this week’s weather this afternoon.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful Sunday fun day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
<p> </p>
