<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> Things started out calm and beautiful this morning, with great visibility and excellent groomers. Riding Skyline you couldn’t feel a breath of wind. However, when you got towards the top you could hear the roar of the wind pummeling the summit of the mountain. Which was a sign of things to come.</p>
<p>Snowmakers enjoyed today off and were able to enjoy some personal time on the hill. Currently, they are scheduled to come back online Friday to fire up West Mountain, Scoot, and Sidewinder. The groomers tonight are going to head out on the hill and groom existing terrain. Plus start the laborious task of pushing out the massive whales on Haulback getting it ready to be open on Saturday. The Terrain Park crew will also be hitting the hill tonight and starting to build out the Stomping Grounds Park which is going to be off the hook this year, but be patient greatness takes time.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for the strong winds to persist from the southwest as snow and mixed precipitation settle in for the night. Nothing heavy though, possibly looking at an inch or two for tomorrow morning. Winds diminish slightly for Thursday forecasted to be 15-30mph at the base and blowing 40-50mph at the summit out of the West. Temperatures remain on the warmer side of things in the mid-to-upper ’20s. The system Friday appears currently to bring us light snowfall in the 1-3” range, but it is a dynamic system and there is still uncertainty among weather models. So do your snow dance and make your sacrifices and let’s will this thing to give us something substantial.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
