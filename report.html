<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Things remained warm and pleasant today as the Sunday Fun Day shredders hit the hill. Calm winds, warm temperatures, and full lift operations allowed for a nice day for folks to enjoy the company of friends and family or relaxing the soul with some quality solo time.</p>
<p>The grooming team plans on hitting the hill in full force tonight grooming all of our snowmaking terrain as well as putting some good time into our trails off the summit. Speaking of snowmaking our crew is set to dust the cobwebs off and return to the hill for the next few days for a final push to hopefully keep us snow riding through April into May.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for dropping temps, cloudy skies, and a few isolated snow showers. This weather continues into Monday night when things begin to clear out for some sunny clear and cold days Tuesday and Wednesday which should offer ideal conditions for racing on Narrow Gauge. However, towards the end of the week, another system moves in that appear to come in the form of the undesirable type. Keep your fingers crossed and your snow dances soulful.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
