<p>Good morning snow riders,</p>
<p>Here we are looking at the last weekend of winter operations here at Sugarloaf, so despite what obligations and projects you might have. Remember it’s never a bad choice to take time for yourself to enjoy some last minute skiing and riding in the western mountains of Maine.</p>
<p>The grooming team last night took to the hill and paved out corduroy on an array of terrain. You’ll find corduroy on the SuperQuad classics plus Narrow Gauge and Sluice. Reports coming in from groomers that there is still quality natural snow from yesterday waiting to be slashed. Today we’ll see SuperQuad and Skyline turning starting at 8:30am.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for mostly cloudy skies with a chance of snow showers, temps in the 30s and winds slightly calmer than yesterday, at speeds ranging from 30-40mph with gusts to 50mph on the summit. Saturday brings mostly cloudy skies with high temps reaching the low 40’s and calmer winds. Closing day on Sunday is looking to be a dream with temps right around freezing overnight. Then sunny skies and temps in the 50’s should bring about one last nostalgic corn harvest for all you farmers out there who are stocking up for the summer,</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
