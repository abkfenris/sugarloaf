<p style="text-align: justify;">Good morning and happy February, Sugarloafers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Tuesday, February 1, marks an end to the month that brought us over two feet of natural snow; let's hope for more of the same this month! The forecasts seem to be moving in our favor, in that department, but in the meantime, the warm air we had yesterday will carry into today, with temperatures estimated to range between 20-24 degrees by the base with teens at the summit. Winds will continue to stay calm and settle, with gusts up to 20 miles per hour from the WNW/WSW at higher elevation terrain. We also expect to see partly sunny skies throughout the day with increasing cloud coverage as we approach evening, so for those hitting the hill first-thing today, be make sure to bring the tinted lenses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have 93 trails open today, stretching just shy of 500 acres across Sugarloaf Mountain; 5 terrain parks are in action, including the new snowboard-cross course on Sidewinder, which just opened this week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last night, our beloved snowmakers were dropping man-made snow on Headwall, Dropline, and Spillway Crosscut to Lombard. Meanwhile, the grooming squad was hard at work striping up their usual weekday hits. Running lifts today will be the weekday usual as of late, with Snubber, DRC, Skyline, Superquad and Skidway starting up at 8:30am, followed by Whiffletree and Timberline at 9:00am.  With rising temperatures and sunny skies, today and tomorrow should be great days to shed a layer or two, have some fun in the sun, maybe even get a taste of that spring skiing we all look forward to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See you out there,</p>
