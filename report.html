<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>What a morning we’ve had here in the mountains of Western Maine! Those who hit the hill first-thing this AM were taking terrific early-season turns under beautiful bluebird skies with plenty of sunshine. We’ve since seen increasing cloud cover overhead since roughly 11:00am, and expect this to remain through last chair today. Snowmaking will be shutting things down on Narrow Gauge around 4:00pm today and continuing work on The Landing, Sluice, and Lower Winter's Way tonight.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Looking ahead to tomorrow, we'll have pockets of sunshine (cue Natasha Bedingfield) with a side of snow showers as temperatures begin a trend of moderation: dress for low 20s at the summit with low 30s by the base.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>We expect to have the same 10 trails for tomorrow, spanning across 56 acres and serviced by our 2 scheduled lifts: the SuperQuad will start spinning at 8:30am, with Timberline following not-too-far-behind at 9:00am. <em><strong>Please note that there will be no beginner terrain available from the top of either lift, and uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Last, but not least, we are entering the final hours of our Cyber Sale, meaning it’s your final chance to purchase a Maine 4-Day ticket pack or lock in the lowest rates on New England College and Nitro passes, plus save on lift tickets and winter lodging! Sale ends at midnight tonight.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Signing off to Snow Reporter Chris,<o:p></o:p></p>
