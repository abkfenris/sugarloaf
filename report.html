<p style="text-align: justify;">Good morning Sugarloaf skiers and riders, and welcome to the morning update of the Mountain Report.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Those planning to hit the hill for Tuesday turns will be skiing or riding under partly sunny skies with temperatures in the teens at the summit and mid-to-high 20s by the base. We expect to see elevated winds from the northwest at higher elevation terrain, so be sure to bundle up, buttercups! Looking ahead, cold temperatures will be sticking around Carrabassett through tomorrow, when we’ll see some slight moderation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In operational news, snowmaking continued overnight on The Landing, and from Upper Gauge to Gin Pole then across to Sluice; the team wrapped up work on Peavy X-Cut while also getting the guns going on Gin Pole and Lower Winter's Way<span>–because r</span>ight now, expanding terrain is the name of the game. Meanwhile, our tireless team of groomers headed to the hill to deliver TLC to their usual trails, with the addition of Kangaroo Hill. The snow cats also hit Lower Gauge for the first time this season, beginning to blade it out, with plans for our groomers to till it out tonight. We're getting closer and closer to seeing those ropes dropping everyday, folks!<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><o:p></o:p>We have 10 open trails for you today, accessible by our 2 scheduled lifts: the SuperQuad is scheduled to start spinning at 8:30am, followed by Timberline going online not-too-far-behind at 9:00am. <em><strong>Please note that there will be no beginner terrain available from the top of either lift.  </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, if you haven’t already, purchase your season pass <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/season-passes">here</a> ASAP—and if you have, make sure you’re ready to hit the hill with ease: avoid lines, filling out forms, time spent indoors, and more by checking if you have any outstanding pre-season tasks to complete at <a href="http://www.arrival.sugarloaf.com">www.arrival.sugarloaf.com</a>. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Lastly<em>, <strong>please note that uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>See you on the slopes,<o:p></o:p></p>
