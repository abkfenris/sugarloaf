<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>One cannot deny that spring is in the air when you can ski Spillway in full sun from top to bottom. Don’t let that bum you out because we got plenty of winter left and March and April historically bring the highest total snowfalls to Sugarloaf, even though that hasn’t been the case the last few years we can hope that we are due.</p>
<p>The grooming team has done such a wonderful job spiffing the mountain back up since our rain/freeze event that took place early in the week, the trails are skiing great and will only continue to get better. The groomers plan on hitting the hill tonight to groom out all of our terrain bringing us back to full on-piste operations for the weekend.</p>
<p>The weather tonight brings wind and cold, low temps around the base will be in the upper teens. Friday brings snow flurries and temps in the upper 20s. Winds dissipate overnight to leave us with wind maxing out around 40mph on the summit, which will likely allow for full lift operations tomorrow. As the details of the storm start to present themselves to the forecasters it is increasingly looking like an all snow event for Sugarloaf. Early totals are calling for 5-9” of wet heavy snow to cake all your favorite runs on Sugarloaf for Saturday. Who’s excited for some storm riding on Saturday?!</p>
<p>Kowabunga,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
