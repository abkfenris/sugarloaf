<p>Good morning Sugarloafers, and what a jolly morning this is!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last night Santa come to town, the Christmas tree was lit, and the snow swirled about, spun up by the holiday spirit. As of 5:30am this morning, we had 4 inches of snow at the base and it’s still coming down! If you’re pondering on whether it’s the right day to finally bust out your new fatty powder boards or not, I’d encourage you to follow your heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last night our snowmakers endured swirling winds, snow, and low visibility to keep things moving forward on Spillway X-Cut, Lombard X-Cut, and Whiffletree, meanwhile the grooming team set out to deliver a little TLC to all of our open terrain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Expect a rather pleasant wintery day today, with temperatures in the low-to-mid 20s and fair winds from the SE at 15 to 30mph; snow showers and the clouds will persist through the day. Temperatures will drop significantly tonight as the evening turns into night, dropping down into low teens and single digits. Overnight skies clear leaving us with a beautiful sunny day on Monday, with fair temperatures and winds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have fun out there today everybody. Keep an eye one another, and ski safely, with caution, because you don’t want to be that person who’s getting schlepped off the hill by one of our fine Ski Patrollers in a toboggan. Always remember, there are friends on a powder day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Safe travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
