<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Ski surfaces softened up as the day went on, and skiers and riders were enjoying the corn harvest before long. As we enter the glory days of the 2022 ski season even if there is no snow in your town we are still truckin’ away skiing wall to wall at Sugarloaf.</p>
<p>The grooming team tonight will again take it easy and enjoy limited operations as things start to scale back in the mountain operations department. Expect a couple of trails to be groomed for tomorrow. Enjoy King Pine while it’s still running because it is scheduled to close at the end of this coming weekend.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for rain showers to settle over the area bringing around an inch of precip from tonight thru Friday morning. If you’re coming up in the next few days grab your trash bag poncho and fishin’ bibs. Friday looks to clear up nicely to a sunny day with warm temps, as we’ll see on and off showers this weekend. Come get it while you can.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
