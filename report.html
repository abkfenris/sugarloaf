<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>I was surprised to see the ground covered with a dusting of white stuff this morning. I had to recall far-away memories to recognize what this strange material was, but I think it will only improve the snow riding quality today.</p>
<p>The grooming team last night manicured all of our on-piste terrain for this morning’s corduroy jamboree. The US Alpine Championships continue on today where top athletes push it to the limit and walk along the razor’s edge on Narrow Gauge.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for mostly cloudy skies with a few snow showers possible. Temperatures start warm with highs around 40 around the base. At some point today the temperatures will begin to drop into tonight where we’ll see lows in the teens at the base. Monday snow showers continue and temps will see a high of around 25 degrees. Winds will begin to strengthen as the snow showers move out and are looking at a few blustery sunny days mid-week.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
