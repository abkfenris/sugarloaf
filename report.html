<p style="text-align: justify;">Happy Monday afternoon, Sugarloafers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><o:p></o:p>We kicked off the second week of the ’21/22 season with beautiful bluebird skies, sunshine, and 10 open trails spanning across 56 acres. Snow surfaces have continued to soften throughout the day under sunny skies, with temperatures remaining in the teens by the summit while hovering right around 30 by the base. Snow Reporter's recommended route for today is Upper Tote Road to King's Landing via Pinch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Snowmaking will continue tonight on The Landing, Upper Gauge to Gin Pole and across to Sluice, completing work on Peavy X-Cut, in addition to getting the guns going on Gin Pole and Lower Winter's Way. Right now, expansion is the name of the game! Meanwhile, our tireless team of groomers will hit the hill to deliver TLC to their usual trails in addition to Kangaroo Hill. They'll also begin to blade Lower Gauge tonight, with plans to till it out tomorrow evening.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Those planning to hit the hill for Tuesday turns will be skiing or riding under partly sunny skies with temperatures in the teens at the summit and mid-to-high 20s by the base. <o:p></o:p>Looking ahead, cold temperatures will be sticking around Carrabassett through Wednesday, when we’ll see some slight moderation. The next chance for snow seems to arrive with an incoming system on Thursday.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Please note that there will be no beginner terrain available from the top of either lift. </strong></em>The SuperQuad is scheduled to start spinning at 8:30am tomorrow morning, followed by Timberline going online not-too-far-behind at 9:00am. So, if you haven’t already, purchase your season pass <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/season-passes">here</a> ASAP—and if you have, make sure you’re ready to hit the hill with ease: avoid lines, filling out forms, time spent indoors, and more by checking if you have any outstanding pre-season tasks to complete at <a href="http://www.arrival.sugarloaf.com">www.arrival.sugarloaf.com</a>. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Lastly<em>, <strong>please note that uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Signing off until tomorrow AM,<o:p></o:p></p>
