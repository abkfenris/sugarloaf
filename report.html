<p><strong>UPDATE: Whiffletree, Skyline, King Pine, on windhold. -8:33am</strong></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>It is extremely slippery outside this morning, travel with caution. Hopefully, temperatures will rise as the morning goes on and the layer of ice that has developed overnight goes away. Proceed with caution it’s wicked greasy, everywhere.</p>
<p>The grooming team is still at it this morning tackling most of our on-piste terrain with a few things being left off like Upper Gondi and Widowmaker/Flume. Currently, the Lift Maintenance crew is assessing wind and ice conditions. When ice builds on the cables of the detachable lifts it affects the un-clamping and clamping of the chair to the cable as they pass through load and unload stations. The report from the top of Skyline this morning is “the chairs are swinging violently” and will start the day on wind hold.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for temps in the upper 30’s with ice and rain drizzles. The winds at TOS this morning were recorded at 40-50mph with stronger gusts, winds are expected to remain strong and increase as we go on today where wind speeds on the summit are forecasted at 65-85 mph overnight. One thing going for us today is the bulk of the rain is going to fall overnight so today shouldn’t be too heavy on the precipitation front.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
