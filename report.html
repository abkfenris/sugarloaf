<p style="text-align: left;">Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another incredible day out there today.<span>  </span>What a warm one, by golly.<span>  </span>Temps were well into the 40’s today on hill.<span>  </span>If you were out there today I’m sure you ditching layers because it is hoodie weather.<span>  </span>We’ve been in a zone these past few days where in one run, you can experience both beautifully firm carving surfaces and playful soft pillows.<span>   </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Temperatures will be getting warmer tonight, and tomorrow will somehow be even hotter than it was today; a<span>s high as 45-49 at the base and 34-38 at the top.  Also forecasted is lots of sunlight and very little wind.  So, maybe bust out the sunscreen tomorrow.  It should be a blast.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For grooming tonight our amazing team of groomers will be ambitiously sculpting all the usual stuff as well as working their way across the eastern face of the hill in preparation for the incredibly fun extended weekend that is the one and only Reggae Fest.  Lifts tomorrow will include SuperQuad, Skyline, Snubber, Skidway and DoubleRunner A. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It’s been a great job all around by mountain ops getting the mountain in the incredible shape it’s in considering what they’ve been dealt by Mother Nature.  There is pretty extensive coverage and everything that is open is skiing great. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> We’ll be at her mercy again this weekend as this wonderful calm will come to an end early Thursday.  I’ll let Chris speculate about the details until then but it has potential to come in all states of matter as the temperature is forecasted to drop to near or below freezing each night the rest of the week.  But, you know – some people feel the rain.  Others just get wet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Brady</p>
