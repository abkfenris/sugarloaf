<p><strong>UPDATE: Strong winds are causing widespread wind holds today. Make sure to check below for up to date lift status. -7:15am</strong></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Things have cooled off and the wind is howling first thing this morning. I’d suggest letting the family sleep in and maybe take your time getting to the hill today.  Maybe stop for a nice breakfast somewhere along the way or if you’re already here, visit 45 North for their wonderful breakfast buffet.</p>
<p>The grooming team is up against it currently with a whole mountain to groom and only half the time to groom it. Due to temperatures yesterday operators arrived at mid-night to start the list that is usually started at 4pm. I’d expect some terrain delays as they work their way east towards the King Pine bowl and Whiffletree. The lift department is currently on the hill assessing wind speeds and so far Skyline and Double Runner Long Side are going to have to start the day on wind hold.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for partly sunny skies, temps reaching a highs around the mid-30s at the base, and winds ranging from 35-45mph with gusts to 65mph on the summit. Winds decline overnight as temperatures settle back in the 20s and clouds move in. Sunday brings mostly cloudy skies, calm winds, and temps around 30 degrees.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
