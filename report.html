<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>We've made it to hump day! After today, there are only a few days left of day dreaming about skiing and riding with friends and loved ones, drinking local draft beer, and dining at your favorite eateries. Those fortunate enough to be here with us for today's shred will enjoy the low-hanging fruits of expansion.</p>
<p>Last night our grooming team set out with expansion on the mind. First shift groomed all existing terrain on Tote Road, Kings Landing, Candy Side, and Low Timberline. Second shift headed out to bust up snowmaking whales, push, flatten, even out, and groom Peavey X-Cut and Lower Narrow Gauge for your cruising enjoyment, bringing our trail count to 12. The snowmaking crew continued production on Sluice, Lower Winters Way, and the Landing and will continue as long as weather allows. </p>
<p>Today’s weather calls for highs in the mid 20s at the summit and mid 30s by the base; winds will be in 10-25 miles per hour range from the west. Also expect some isolated flurries and pockets of sun throughout the day. We are tracking our next uncoming storm system which is due to arrive tomorrow, more on that this afternoon. Carpe Diem Sugarloafers!</p>
<p>TLDR: 12 trails, 2 lifts, pockets of sun and isolated flurries. New terrain: Peavey X-Cut, Lower Narrow Gauge.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that there will be no beginner terrain available from the top of either lift, and uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em></p>
<p>Catch you right here in the afternoon,</p>
<p>Chris </p>
