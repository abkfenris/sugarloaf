<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Well the mountain got a little beat up from the warm temperatures and rain from last night, but things are still looking good and we’ve got plenty of snow to go skiing on. With a beautiful weekend ahead with a warm days and cool crisp nights you can be sure we are in for another bountiful corn harvest at the loaf.</p>
<p>The grooming team tonight will tackle the hill in a limited fashion due to weather. Look for a trail or two to be groomed off of each lift. Timberline lift was on conditions closure today due to lack of snow at the summit. Our grooming team will do everything in their power to keep us skiing off Maines 2<sup>nd</sup> tallest mountain as long as possible.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for cloudy skies and increasing winds, temperatures will drop to a low of around 22 degrees at the base. Tomorrow we are looking at a day with partly sunny skies with temps reaching highs of around 37 degrees at the base. Winds appear to be a possible issue tomorrow with speeds reaching 45-60mph on the upper mountain. With these forecasts I wouldn’t be surprised to see some wind holds tomorrow. Things cool off again Saturday night as winds die off into Sunday with another partly sunny day and highs in the 40s.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
