<p>Happy Saturday Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Warm temps and melting persisted during the overnight hours last night, and the top of Sugarloaf this morning is reading 31 degrees. It’s probably pretty safe to say things are going to be soft and enjoyable today.</p>
<p>The grooming department dispersed on the hill last night to tackle a large list of targets.  You’ll find Sugarloaf classics such as Skidder and Spillway with fresh corduroy. Also, you’ll find corduroy in a few places there is often not, such as Binder and Pole Line. You can check below for a full list of groomed terrain for today. With 10 lifts scheduled to turn and 770 acres to explore you’ll have as much adventure as you can bite off today.</p>
<p>Today the weather calls for warm temps and scattered mixed precipitation throughout the day. Temps will be balmy reaching the upper 30s. Winds start to ramp up late morning where the upper mountain will see speeds in the 35-50mph range. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a few lifts be placed on wind hold if that forecast pans. As always you can check back here at the mountain report or follow us <a href="https://twitter.com/SugarloafSnow"> (@SugarloafSnow)</a> on Twitter for real-time lift information and updates.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
