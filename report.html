<p>Good afternoon Skiers and Riders,</p>
<p> Well Mother Nature has been, to say the least a little bit of an inconvenience to us here at Sugarloaf. So of course we have taken things into our own hands to provide us all the best possible conditions. Snow guns running on sluice today served up some delicious and soft turns for all who braved skiing under the guns.  Soft turns today and the prospect of soft turns at deck for tomorrow sure have this snow reporter feeling excited for the future.</p>
<p>Once again, the grooming department will head out on the hill to corduroy up all of our available terrain. Making ready 26 trails over 148 acres. The snowmaking department had to shut things down today due to unfavorable temps, and an approaching storm. They are planning to get things going again early on Friday.</p>
<p>Anticipate snow showers starting up tonight around 8 and being the heaviest between 10 and 2am. The temps tonight remain on the mild side around the upper 20s. Winds will be around 15mph. The second part of the storm drags in warm air tomorrow forcing precip to turn into a mix. Temps will quickly rise tomorrow as the morning goes on to around 40 degrees. Winds will remain on the calmer side and range from 15 to 35mph. Mixed precip will continue into Thursday night before tapering off early Friday morning.  Turns are more than likely going to be the best first thing tomorrow, so plan ahead and get yourself here before the locals eat it all up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Also on Saturday is our annual <a href="/events-calendar/tree-lighting-festival" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tree Lighting Festival</a>—and Santa Claus will be coming to town, accompanied by Amos and friends! Come celebrate the season in Sugarloaf style with warm treats, music on the Beach, fireworks, and more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Enjoy your night,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris</p>
