<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>This morning was a little bit worrisome but at 10 am things kicked into storm mode and took us to pow town. So far, as of 2pm we’ve seen 4-5 inches of dense snow that covering and staying on the trails nicely. Winds shifted directions and allowed all lifts to run with the exception of Timberline. With the snow forecasted to fall into the overnight hours, tomorrow is looking like a prime day to get hype for some soft snow riding.</p>
<p>Tonight the grooming team will hit the hill and buff out all the soft bumps created by all the skiers and riders made today and will cover most piste terrain from West Mountain over to Haulback. Ski Patrol will be poking around the mountain this afternoon and tomorrow looking for the first opportunity to get new terrain back open for some more fresh snow riding opportunities.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for continued snowfall and cooling temps. Accumulation totals overnight are in the 2-4 inch range, and as things cool down the snow will get lighter and more powdery. Leaving us with a wonderful right-side up snowpack for Sunday fun day. Winds shift back around to the NW tomorrow in the category of strong. Speeds will range from 30-45mph with gusts to 65mph at the summit. With the change of wind direction and the speeds that are forecasted, be prepared for the possibilities of wind holds tomorrow. Always remember that we’ll have the T-Bar and you’ll get to appreciate the history and heritage of riding an old-fashion lift. Which if you didn’t know can get you most places on the mountain with a short 5 min walk to the Skyline unload via Upper Narrow Gauge.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
