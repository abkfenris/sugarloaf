<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The weekend might be coming to a close but the memories of the smiles and laughs sliding around free in the mountains of Maine will always be there. We are indeed fortunate to have a place where these experiences are created. Also to have a hobby that can brighten up the long dark winters of Maine. Bring an unsuspecting friend or co-worker next time you visit and share the Sugarloaf experience.</p>
<p>Today the snowmaking squad fired up additional equipment on Upper Timberline, Upper Comp Hill, and Drop Line while maintaining operations on Gondola Line. With another cold night forecasted the piles will certainly grow at a satisfying rate. The grooming team will once again hit the hill to butter out most of our on-piste terrain. Tomorrow we are looking at running 6 lifts, servicing 82 trails, on 436 acres.</p>
<p>The weather tonight brings more cold temps around 0 degrees at the bast tonight, with winds elevating to the 25-40mph range. Temps moderate slightly on Monday from temps around 10 at the base and 0 at the summit. Skies will be variable with a mix of sun and clouds. Tomorrow looks to be another delightful day where lift operations should go unaffected by wind at 15-20mph. Monday night looks to bring a chance of snow showers that will last into Tuesday. Wishing everybody a great start to their week.</p>
<p>Chris</p>
