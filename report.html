<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The snow just keeps coming and the prime mid-season conditions at Sugarloaf persist. With yesterday’s dense snow and a beautiful sunny day ahead of us. It is once again time to grab your best pal, your coveralls, and your dads ski equipment from the 80’s to come enjoy yourself a day of Hot Doggin’ on Maine Day.</p>
<p>Last night the grooming team had a large task ahead of them grooming out all the standard trails. A few stand out missions were Binder from TOS, Buckboard, and Springboard. If you’re looking for some easy bumps to practice in on a gentle pitch. Check out the skiers right side of Haywire towards the bottom has the terrain you need to get yourself ripping Sugarloafs first ever trail, Winters Way.</p>
<p>Today the weather calls for sun with a few clouds. Moderate winds in the 20-40mph and temperatures in the comfortable range of the mid-to-upper 20s. Temperatures cool slightly tonight to dip into the low 20’s while winds shift around to the south, and eventually becoming SE by Thursday. Tomorrow we expect light snow showers temps in the 20s and moderate winds 15-35mph.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
