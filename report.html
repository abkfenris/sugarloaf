<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Today we are looking at a sunny start with increasing clouds throughout the day as another rainstorm settles in over the area. It is quite incredible how resilient our Carrabassett Cream snow surface has been and how it stands up to such brutality from Mother Nature.</p>
<p>Grooming operations are beginning to wind down for the year as many trails become too thin to be groomed regularly. So last night operators hit Tote Road, Sluice, and Ramdown, along with the slow skiing areas around the base of the mountain.</p>
<p>Temperatures today will reach a high of around 50 degrees at the base as rain moves into the area for this afternoon and overnight. Thursday brings a wet day with a high of around 45 degrees at the base while the summit sees temps in the mid-30s. Friday looks to be our next sunny day with high temperatures around 50 degrees at the base.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
