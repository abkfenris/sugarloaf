<p>Update 7:55am: Some power outage blips were experienced throughout the region this morning.  However, CMP has assured us that the issue has been resolved.  Superquad and Skyline will open as scheduled, remaining lifts may open a few minutes behind schedule.</p>
<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>There’s a lot to look forward to this week with a stretch of cold air coming in, some fresh snow from the weekend, and an end to the ever-flowing stream of Dead puns.  I am writing to you this Monday morning as I realize how far through this season we are and I just can’t wait for more and more days like yesterday.</p>
<p>It’s so good to see the trail total coming in this morning as we’ve claimed back a significant amount of the terrain we lost in those rain storms.  Nearly 100 trails open totaling over 400 acres, the wide and tall stretches of Sugarloaf Mountain will be reachable today via our 11 chair lifts: Superquad, Skyline, Double Runner, Sawduster, Skidway, Snubber and West Mountain starting at 8:30am and Whiffletree, King Pine and Timberline at 9:00am.  As I type many trails are getting a lovely makeover from our grooming team who have been out all night hitting their weeknight routine per usual.  I would be remiss if I forgot to mention we also have 6 open terrain parks that need shredding: Boardwalk, Dropline, Sidewinder, Spurline, Stomping Grounds and Upper Tote.  </p>
<p>Bundle up for some single digit to negative temps today.  At the base we read 6-10 degrees with NW winds of 15-30mph.  Up at the top we’re between -6 and -2 degrees with 35-50mph NW winds.  Partial sun is expected.  Tonight will stay cold and windy with it warming up about 10 degrees tomorrow with chance for snow showers.  Learn more about that and weather for the rest of the week in this afternoon’s report.</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
