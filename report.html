<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow yesterday so according to legend, we are still in for another 6 weeks of winter. This morning isn’t feeling exactly winterish with rain drizzling down on the beautifully preserved snowpack we’ve had since January. This however will be quickly remedied by another storm forecasted to drop a respectable amount of dense and heavy snow. It may not be the most pleasing snow to ski but is surely going to build our base substantially.</p>
<p>Last night saw warm temps and drizzle which limited our grooming operations. Basically, you’ll find one groomed trail off each lift today. Tote Road, Ramdown, Whiffletree, and Bridal Chain/Timberline was the only trails groomed along with the base area. Yesterday on the radio I heard traffic about Brackett Basin, which is indeed a good sign that is it on the radar of Ski Patrol. The lift department is currently on the hill assessing winds and so far it appears Skyline and SuperQuad are cleared for operations today.</p>
<p>The weather this morning is quite interesting. Groomers are reporting a watery drizzle around Whiffletree, while another simultaneously reported heavy snow at Bullwinkles. Temperatures remain balmy in the low-to-mid 30s. Winds are forecasted at a stiff 40-55mph from the SW on the upper mountain. This afternoon is when the fun begins. Around 2 pm temps begin the slow and steady decline to below freezing and snow begins to dominate. The heaviest snow is forecasted to fall overnight between 8 pm and 5 am with heavy snow continuing into the first part of tomorrow. Snow totals are forecasted in the 12+ inch range and winds are forecasted at 15-30mph tomorrow most likely allowing for full lift operations. So hold onto your butts and get your sudden ailment prepared for your superiors this afternoon because tomorrow is going to be the best day 2022.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
