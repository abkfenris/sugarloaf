<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>We’ve made it past another hump day and are truckin’ towards another weekend of snow riding, eating, dancing, and laughing. Several acts of entertainment are lined up for this weekend including Bob Marley and The Ghost of Paul Revere. With the soft snow persisting from recent storms. It is surely going to be another memorable weekend of leisure here at Sugarloaf.</p>
<p>The grooming team last night hit the hill to buff out all the usual suspects, a few trails were left off the list including Haulback, Flume, and Comp Hill. As always make sure to check below for a detailed trail report. Today the lift department has 8 lifts scheduled to turn to service our 636 acres of terrain.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for snow showers with an inch or two possible. Mild temps in the mid-to-upper 20s with winds in the 20-35mph range from the Southwest. Friday things look to clear up for a sunny day with continued mild temperatures and moderate winds. After a weak disturbance Saturday, things appear to be dry until late next week, which brings a chance of statewide precipitation.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
