<p>Hello Skiers and Riders,</p>
<p> Today was one of them Sugarloaf days where your devotion is significantly strained. However I enjoyed some lift rides with some enthusiastic skiers and riders. Whom of which were still happy as a clam in the mud at high tide to be out enjoying the trails. The snow was soft, fast, and predictable enough to make you want to get on the lift again. One thing is for certain after a day of shredding in this weather the hot shower at the end of the day will be most welcome.</p>
<p>Tonight will be a generally quiet night for the Mountain Ops department. Snowmaking will remain offline. The groomers will not be able to get out on the hill till early Sunday morning due to temperatures. With strong winds forecasted tomorrow as well the snow cats are going to focus on first grooming from the Top of Double Runner Long Side and down.</p>
<p>Rain and wind will continue battering the mountain into the night. Precipitation starts to taper off around 2am. Then the temperature slowly start to making its way back down towards freezing. Tomorrow we are expecting temps to be in the mid to high twenties with strong winds from the NW around 40mph, with gusts to 70 at the summit. Skies will be partially clear allowing some sun to poke through. Make sure to check us out here at the mountain report or @sugarloafsnow on twitter for all the latest updates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*due to weather tomorrow be ready for possible lift and trail closures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Have a cozy night,</p>
