<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>If yesterday’s brilliant afternoon was any sort of sneak peek into what we’ll see today, we are looking to be set up for a sublime Saturday of snow sliding at Sugarloaf. Make sure to grab your best pal, favorite ski goodies, and some sunglasses because we are in for a warm pleasant day on the hill.</p>
<p>The grooming team hit the hill hard last night turning out corduroy from Timberline all the way over to Haulback. They also worked on repairing trails from the summit which were scorched by last week’s hot weather and pummeled by this week’s wildcard weather. The Technical Events for the US Alpine Championship are set to take place today on Narrow Gauge. The competition can be viewed at the Jean Luce building on Peavey X-cut, the load area of the T-Bar, or Tote Cross Cut skiers left on Lower Comp Hill.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for partly sunny skies and a high near 40 degrees around the base. Winds are in the mellow category with gusts only to 30 mph expected at the summit. Sunday look to bring another decent day with clouds moving in with a chance of snow showers and highs are the base reaching 36 degrees. Things cool off into the week with some clear days mid-week, then once again clouds move back into the region as we are looking to get hit with another storm for the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the last week of March.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
