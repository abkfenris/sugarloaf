<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>As you slept, teams of Winter Kids have been skiing throughout the dark and cold night. I’d imagine some of them must be pretty grateful to see the glow of the coming sunrise. Then the few who are not would probably be a good fit for our night operations in snowmaking and grooming. With a nice day ahead and the forecast for the next few days, today is surely a day to take advantage of awesome soft conditions winter conditions and have yourself a good old fashion bell to bell day.</p>
<p>The grooming department remained busy throughout the night grooming all of our terrain for today’s adventure.  Everything from West Mountain, to the Summit, through King Pine Bowl, has been buffed with a corduroy surface for this morning’s early birds. The Terrain Park Crew has also been hard at work maintaining our five terrain parks. Definitely take time to check out our Border Cross Park on Sidewinder to have some friendly competition and test your skills on the banked turns and rollers. Those who crave to huck their meat should journey to the Drop Line park where we have Sugarloaf’s largest terrain park features.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for partly sunny skies, warming temperatures, and moderate winds. We appear to have a full sun start but eventually, clouds move in throughout the day ahead of an approaching storm system. Temps are pleasant in the 20, and winds are at an average range of 20-40mph. Light snow moves into the area early Sunday morning, then changes over to a mixed type during the day Sunday. Temps Sunday will reach a high of around 40 at the base, while winds from the SW crank away at a range of 50-70mph at the summit.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
