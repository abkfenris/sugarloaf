<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Pockets of sun and warm temperatures are making for a wonderful close to an awesome weekend of Reggae Festing. The corn harvest was on again today delivering soft buttery turns for all who made powered through and made it to the hill today. Although we have to wave goodbye to our first Reggae Fest since the pandemic we still have more snow riding to look forward to before spring completely takes over our beloved mountain.</p>
<p>The grooming team tonight will hit the hill and groom out a respectable amount of terrain for a relaxing day of spring skiing on Monday. Patrol has been making their rounds and opening some natural snow trails up as soft conditions prevail.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for clearing skies with the possibility of a few isolated showers. Temps appear to drop below freezing at the base during the overnight hours, then warming back up to nearly 50 degrees Monday. Tomorrow winds are moderate at 20-40mph from the NW. Sun looks to prevail for the day leaving us another beautiful sunny day of spring skiing. The week ahead brings a mostly active pattern of on and off rain showers with cool night time temps and temps reaching the mid-to-upper 40s during the day.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
