<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Bust out the sunglasses, bring your Rasta flags, and blare some Steel Pulse because it’s… not even close to April 7th! It’s only February and we got several months of winter to enjoy before celebrating our 34<sup>th</sup> Annual Reggae Fest. Seeing the Whiffletree thermometer read 40 degrees while at the same time seeing the sun bask most of Sugarloaf in warm light had me confused about the time of year.</p>
<p>The grooming team will head out on the hill in force and groom all available terrain that has had snowmaking. Terrain which, overall has grown quite a bit and still has a little more room to go. With the end in sight and a good run of cold weather ahead the snowmaking team will hit the hill (hopefully) for the last time on Monday to finish off Nitro, Gondi, and Narrow Gauge from the summit. The grooming team has also made ready a road for Cat Skiing starting tomorrow on Burnt Mountain.</p>
<p>Clouds start to move in during the overnight hours along with stronger winds. Temps drop slightly below freezing overnight before again rising Saturday to highs of around 38 degrees around the base. Expect light mixed precipitation to persist tomorrow throughout most of the day. Winds are on the strong side reaching 35-55mph on the upper mountain, which is strong enough to possibly shut down lifts going up high. This kind of weather is inevitable skiing in New England so you just got to go out and ski it anyway and remember. At least it will be soft.</p>
<p>Don’t forget this weekend The Widowmaker is hosting Portland natives The Ghost of Paul Revere Saturday night with things kicking off at 8 pm. Check out a few of my favorites here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rcQj3aNbgE">The Ghost of Paul Revere - Little Bird (Official Music Video) - YouTube</a>   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK6fxcgetDU">This Is the End - YouTube</a></p>
