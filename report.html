<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>All the clouds are moving out and the bluebirds are singing brightly. Make sure to grab your chapstick, sunscreen, and your sunglasses because otherwise, you’re just going to get sunburned. We still have heaps of terrain open for all of your smooth groomer, and spring hot doggin’ needs, so sneak away and enjoy an incredible day of snow riding at Sugarloaf.</p>
<p>Last night the grooming team hit a variety of terrain. Today from the tops of the lifts you’ll find corduroy on Tote Road, Kings Landing, Sluice, and Ramdown, as well as a variety of beginner terrain on the lower mountain. For lifts today we will have Sky Line, SuperQuad, King Pine, and Double Runner to swoosh you around during the nice spring day.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for bluebird and a high temps in the 50s around the base. Winds are chillin’ in the 15-30mph range from the west, unlikely to affect lift operations today. Tonight brings the onset of more weather that is appearing to last through the weekend with some possible mixing. Our next sunny day is looking to happen on Monday.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
