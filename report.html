<p>Well kids, today is shaping up to be the kind of day that spring skiing dreams are made of. The sun is bright, snow is plentiful, and temps are already on their way up with highs in the low 50s expected today. If you're looking for a great way to spend your Patriots' Day, this is it.</p>
<p>Temps dropped down below freezing last night so surfaces are definitely on the firm side this morning. Groomers were out and about last night on most of the usual suspects between Tote Road and Gondi Line (see the full list below), and you'll probably want to stick to those first thing this morning until the sun softens things up and the corn harvest truly begins. </p>
<p>For lifts today we'll have the SuperQuad, Skyline, and Double Runner East all opening at 8:30am. There's hardly a breath of wind out there this morning, and it doesn't look like winds will be an issue for us at all today, but as always, be sure to check out the lift report below for current lift status. And if you're looking ahead through the final two weeks of the season here, you can see our <a href="/spring-operations-schedule">anticipated spring lift operations schedule right here</a>.</p>
<p>If you're riding the SuperQuad today, keep an eye out for Sugarloafer Myles Silverman, who is attempting to break the Guinness World Record for most vertical feet snowboarded in 12 hours. He'll be lapping Narrow Gauge and the SuperQuad all day long, so give him a thumbs up if you see him out there. </p>
<p>Looking beyond today's corn chowder fest, the weather is going to get a bit more interesting tomorrow. Forecasts are calling for up to a half a foot of snow during the day tomorrow, and we've seen these late spring storms overperform at higher elevations in the past. We'll keep you updated with the latest right here. </p>
<p>Don't forget the sunscreen.</p>
