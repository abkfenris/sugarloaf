<p style="text-align: justify;">Good morning Sugarloaf skiers and riders,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to the second week of the ’21/22 season!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the weekend, our tireless team of sensational snowmakers took advantage of the cool temperatures to blow snow, getting the guns going on Narrow Gauge; Snow Reporter Chris says the snow is indeed piling up in there, which means it won’t be long now before Ski Patrol drops the ropes. Snowmaking cintinue on Upper Narrow Gauge today as well as The Landing, Peavy Cross Cut, and Sluice; right now, expanding terrain is the name of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, our groomers got to work in the wee hours smoothing out all of our available terrain—that’s a total of 10 trails, with 56 open acres, accessible by 2 lifts—which means we’ll have a nice reset of roy for first turns. Those starting their week the Sugarloaf way (by heading to the hill!) can count on sunny skies and temperatures in the high teens to low 20s at the summit, with high 20s to low 30s by the base. We expect winds to stay relatively calm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Please note that there will be no beginner terrain available from the top of either lift.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking ahead, cold temperatures will be sticking around Carrabassett through Wednesday, when we’ll see some slight moderation. The next chance for snow seems to arrive with an incoming system on Thursday.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, if you haven’t already, purchase your season pass <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/season-passes">here</a> ASAP—and if you have, make sure you’re ready to hit the hill with ease: avoid lines, filling out forms, time spent indoors, and more by checking if you have any outstanding pre-season tasks to complete at <a href="http://www.arrival.sugarloaf.com">www.arrival.sugarloaf.com</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, <em><strong>please note that uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See you on the slopes,</p>
<p>Gabby</p>
<p> </p>
