<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>In three words I can sum up everything I’ve learned about life—it goes on.  The dawn rises on this Tuesday morning, as it does every morning, and there shall be skiing. </p>
<p>Temperature and wind at the base are predicted to be 23-27 degrees with SE 15-25 mph winds, and at the top 25-29 degrees with winds of WSW/SW 40-60 mph.  Sky cover should be mostly cloudy, as we expect snow flurries that should remain dry throughout the ski day.  However, tonight that snow will turn to a snow/mix and then to rain. </p>
<p>Last night into this morning our incredible grooming team was hard at work keeping things pristine, hitting most of the open terrain on the mountain including Hayburner and Kings Landing.  Snowmaking is offline for the rest of the week, but there’s still a wide variety of terrain to choose from here at the Loaf with over 70 trails and close to 400 acres of open skiing now including 6 terrain parks with Dropline open.</p>
<p>First tracks this morning opens up Superquad and Skyline at 7:30am, for the extra dedicated, while the rest of our 11 lifts are set to run at their normally scheduled times: DRC East, DRC West, Sawduster, Skidway, Snubber and West Mountain at 8:30am; Whiffletree, King Pine and Timberline at 9:00am (wind allowing). </p>
<p>As mentioned, tonight we are going to see those flurries turn into a wintry mix and eventually into rain – be sure to check back in to the afternoon report for more updates and details, but, let’s go enjoy today and think about that later.</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
