<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Update</strong>: As of 1:30pm, King Pine remains on wind hold.</p>
<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to a foot of fresh snow, today's skiing and riding conditions were some of the season's best. Fortunately, the winds (mostly) held back and we were able to get as high as Skyline, while Ski Patrol made their way around the mountain, dropping ropes on another handful of trails. They'll continue poking around over the next few days to see if there are any other trails or glades that can be added to the list but as of this report, we're now skiing and riding more than 350 acres of terrain, spanning 71 open trails. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few mounds and moguls left here and there if that’s what you are looking for. Other than that, grooming is going to put in another hard night's work prepping trails and getting things cleaned up nicely. Snowmakers will enjoy another night off as the grooming team heads to work with a hefty list of trails to smooth out for tomorrow. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tomorrow, we expect to see temperatures in the mid-to-high teens, with relatively calm winds that shouldn't impact lift operations. But as always, be sure to check back in here for the latest updates in the morning, or follow the mountain operations account on Twitter – <a href="https://twitter.com/SugarloafSnow">@SugarloafSnow</a>. </p>
<p>Have a great night,</p>
<p>David  </p>
