<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The conditions certainly delivered today and the murmurs were true – it was a great Monday.  I was wrong about one thing in the forecast (that it would be sunny) but the substitution of snowfall turned out to be a fan favorite.  My tracks kept getting re-covered under King Pine, and the snow on the sides was dreamy.  I even ran into a veteran ‘Loafer friend of mine who showed me some hidden powder stashes that I didn’t even know existed.  Unreal day.</p>
<p>The warm temperatures we've been seeing out there are just so lovely and enjoyable.  Today we were around 32 degrees at base with mild winds, and 23 at top with significant Western winds putting Timberline on hold for the day.  As I mentioned we had light snowfall from around the time we opened the lifts to noon or so – accumulation we are calling about an inch.</p>
<p>Tonight we may see some stuff higher up towards the summit get groomed as high winds have kept our cats from going up there the past couple nights.  Besides that we’re looking at your typical weekday routine.  For lifts tomorrow, we have 7 scheduled to run including Snubber, Skidway, Superquad and Skyline at 8:30am with King Pine, Whiffle Tree and Timberline following at 9:00am.  I’ve been told that if Timberline goes on wind hold tomorrow then (wo)man power will be shifted to run Doublerunner to get that going in its stead.</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s weather looks pretty similar to today.  Forecast at the base shows 32-36 degrees with mild winds, at the top we see 22-26 degrees with potential to get colder as those winds coming from the West could get up to similar speeds as this morning.  The sky cover prediction for tomorrow is mostly cloudy.</p>
<p>As I seem to have mentioned several times now, it will be a pretty warm week; particularly towards the end when we are slated for potential precipitation...  This past weekend we weren’t sure how we’d do and it turned out awesome!  So let’s all hope for a similar outcome this upcoming weekend.  Only thing we can do for now is enjoy skiing this incredible mid-week weather.  Make sure to check back in the morning for the latest updates.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
