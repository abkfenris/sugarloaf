<p>Good morning sleepyheads,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hoping everyone had a wonderful night reminiscing on a fun day, spent with friends and family in the glory of the western Maine Mountains. Sun exposure and exercise are some of the most affective combatants of seasonal depression. With another sunny day on our doorstep, the time to take advantage is now, so grab your best pal, get in the whip, take a cruise, and get yourself a nice strong dose of sunny snow sliding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last night, our snowmaking and grooming crews got to catch a breath after a good push of expansion. The snowcats were out hitting all of our open 105 acres of skiing and riding terrain, while the snowmaking crew focused on Spillway, which is well on its way to being ready for our enjoyment.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather today is calling for temps in the low 20s and winds ranging around 18mph at the base to 30mph at the summit. Take it all in today, because this coming week has us in an active, messy pattern of Maine winter delight, with multiple storms rolling through dropping everything from snow to... the word that must not be said. Thankfully this is nothing far from the realm of regular reality to us Sugarloafers, and we are well-versed in adversity when it comes to skiing on our beloved mountain.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em></p>
<p>Catch you here in the afternoon,</p>
<p>Chris </p>
