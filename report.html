<p>Hello Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> ‘Twas the night before Christmas and all through the hills, everyone was shredding, with marvelous skills. The powder boards sat near the window with care, in hopes that pow days galore would soon be there. The rippers were nestled all snug in their beds. While visions of face shots danced in their heads. And Amos with his antlers, and Berry with her bread. Had just settled in for the long winter’s shred.</p>
<p>Today our snowmakers took advantage of a cold, clear day and maintained operations on Widowmaker, Flume, Choker, Tohaul, Stomping grounds, and Cruiser. These ideal weather conditions significantly increase production. I’d be willing to bet we’ll be riding in the King Pine Bowl, enjoying the early morning sun in the next few days. The groomers will put the finishing touches on Spillway Cross-Cut and Ramdown scheduled to be available for tomorrow. </p>
<p>Skies are clear tonight, with temps in the low-to-mid teens. . Tomorrow expects calm winds and warmer temperatures as a storm system rolls in. There has been a lot of uncertainty leading up to tomorrow’s event. It appears tomorrow the system is going to possibly start warm and quickly cool off as the bulk of the storm hits us Saturday night. Currently, we are looking at 2-4 inches of total snowfall. Tomorrow we have 9 lifts scheduled servicing 33 trails over 194 acres of terrain for your Christmas Day Delights.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Merry Christmas to all, and to all goodnight!</p>
<p>Chris</p>
