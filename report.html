<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Despite the watery and moist atmosphere today, ski conditions were actually pretty good. The stickiness of the last few days went away as the snow turned into more of a granular form overnight with the colder temperatures. With more of this same weather due tonight into tomorrow, we all must do our part and do our dances and make our sacrifices to appease the snow gods.</p>
<p>The grooming team tonight will again have reduced operations on the hill tonight to help preserve our snowpack so we can be riding well past Reggae Fest. What happens when the snowpack becomes saturated with rain the snow absorbs a lot of the water and acts like a sponge. When you drive a 20,000lbs machine on it, all the water gets squeezed and forced out of the snow like squeezing the sponge, but the sponge ever expands back to its original form.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for continued disappointment. Temps remain mild around freezing while rain and freezing drizzle falls all over our beloved mountain. Winds Remain mild with speeds around 20 at the base. Sunday winds calm down and switch directions to the WNW coming at speeds from 15-30mph on the upper mountain, which should allow for full lift operations tomorrow. Showers taper off through the day while temperatures start warm in the 40s then trickle down in the afternoon and evening before reaching a low around 19 degrees on the summit Sunday night. The week ahead dries up and seasonable temperatures return mostly in the 20s. The first part of the week looks sunny and pleasant then the end of the week brings isolated snow showers followed by another potential storm for next weekend. Keep your snow dances vigorous and your sacrifices worthy.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful night,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
