<p>Happy Monday, Sugarloaf skiers and riders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Precipitation began in the early hours of the morning, first falling as snow before beginning to mix; it's forecasted that we should see this system switch entirely to rain by the afternoon. I'd classify the current weather on-hill as BYOS (Bring Your Own Squeegee). Temperatures have entered a trend of moderation into the mid-40s by the base today, paired with elevated winds from the south-southwest, with gusts between 55 and 70 mph at the summit. Please be prepared that this may impact lift operations, though at the time, our 3 lifts are spinning as scheduled. We will continue to update the Mountain Report, as well as our Snow Reporting Twitter account <a href="twitter.com/sugarloafsnow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@SugarloafSnow</a>, with the latest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Our tireless team has continued on the march of expansion, getting the guns going on The Birches, Hayburner, and Spillway overnight; </span>they have since shut down operations to weather this storm. Following this front, which will hold through tonight, we expect temperatures to cool down into prime-time snowmaking range, with another low pressure front moving in midweek. In other operational news, our groomers were cruising the slopes all evening, delivering a little TLC to all of our open terrain<span>–which, by the way, is 18 trails spanning across over 100 acres.</span></p>
<p>For those heading to the hill tomorrow, we expect to have mostly cloudy skies with temperatures in the teens at the summit and 20s by the base. Winds will subside, though there still may be blustery conditions at higher elevation terrain. Check back here first-thing tomorrow for more information.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em></p>
<p>See you on the slopes,</p>
<p>Gabrielle</p>
