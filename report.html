<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Holy cow the sunny days just keep on coming.  Reggae Fest may be in the rearview but we're still riding the good vibes like they're going out of style. With temperatures near fifty today, today is likely the pick of the week. </p>
<p>Tonight things will stay pretty warm with predicted temps in the 30’s at both base and top.  Our team of groomers will have their work cut out for them as always with Narrow Gauge, Hayburner, King’s Landing and Tote Road on the list to be smoothed out. In addition, they will also begin work leveling features in Dropline to construct the pond for the East Coast Pond Skimming Championships this Saturday, April 16th.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we'll see temperatures ranging from 40-44 at base, 33-37 at top. Wind gusts are expected to kick up and may be accompanied by a wintry mix of rain and snow depending on how high up on the mountain you are.  Lifts for tomorrow will be the same as today with SuperQuad, Skyline and DRC East starting at 8:30am followed by King Pine at 9:00am</p>
<p>Looking a bit further ahead in the forecast we see chances of PM rain predicted on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  None of these rainstorms have caused too much devastation to snow conditions as our base is holding up – it’s more like managing the cyclical nature of moisture and temperature – and I wouldn’t expect anything but excellence from our operations teams when it comes to keeping us afloat.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
