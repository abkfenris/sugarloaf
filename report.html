<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> Early birds this morning were treated to an additional helping of cream cheese on top of their regularly scheduled corduroy harvest. We appear to have been spared the worst of the back end of this system. We experienced only a few patchy drizzles today softening things up nicely for todays rippers. With this storm on the way out of town, we can be thankful and look forward to the changes the mountain is likely to see this weekend.</p>
<p>Today snowmakers hit the hill and prepared for snowmaking operations to start up as soon as the temps drop to favorable levels. They have things ready to go on Skidder, boardwalk, lower scoot, and Whiffle Tree. The grooming team is scheduled to head out tonight and reorganize all that cream cheese that was kicked around today, as well as push out the piles on Boardwalk to make room for more snowmaking.</p>
<p>Tonight the weather calls for increasing winds to around 40mph under cloudy skies as this storm departs. Temps remain warm around 40 degrees at the base tonight. Tomorrow expect some wind in the 35mph range, clouds, and the temperatures begin to slowly drop during the day and eventually getting to the low twenties on the mountain tomorrow night. With our first big storm due to arrive this weekend (4”-7”) and what appears to be a cold and active weather pattern continuing into next week. Things feel like we might be getting ready to put early season behind us and get ready to settle into the main course of winter.</p>
