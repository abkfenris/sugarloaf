<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO DAN (DANO) BARKER, MASTER SNOW SURFACE TECHNICIAN!</p>
<p>Hope everybody is enjoying themselves this afternoon. I would be suspicious of anyone who found something to complain about. Pristine groomers, sun, and calm winds may have made this the best day of the season so far. The early birds were getting after it this morning eating up all of those delicious worms that were for the taking.</p>
<p>Our snowmaking team enjoyed near ideal conditions this morning and today. I had a chance to go peak into Narrow Gauge and the snow is indeed piling up in there, won’t be long now. Tonight snowmakers plan on shutting off a good portion of Narrow Gauge and heading over to Sluice, Peavey Cross Cut, and the Landing. Tonight our groomers will be at it again smoothing out all our available terrain to give us a nice reset of roy for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the weather for tomorrow skiers and riders can expect clouds and snow showers with temperatures starting in the high teens and rising into the mid-twenties by the afternoon. Winds will stay relatively calm coming from the SW. Thanks for a wonderful first weekend here at sugarloaf and wishing everybody a safe journey back home this evening.</p>
