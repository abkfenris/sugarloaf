<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Happy Monday, Happy Valentine's day, and my condolences to all the fellow Burrow fans out there.  Get ready to bundle up this morning because temperatures continued to drop last night.  Conditions are firm and fast, but I am always amazed to see what the grooming team is able transform it into.  Should be a good one to get out there early, and we may even see the sun later in the day.</p>
<p>Base today will see temps in the single digits and 12-18mph NNW wind.  Top will be reaching into the negatives with winds carrying at approximately 15-25 WSW/NW.  Partial clouds this morning should continue well into the day but we expect partial sunlight in the afternoon. </p>
<p>Sugarloaf Groomers had their hands full over the past few days transitioning from temperatures in the mid 40’s back to single digit and below zero temperatures.  They’ve been working tirelessly to maintain our trails over this busy weekend and are back to the weekday grooming routine.  In other exciting news, Sugarloaf Terrain Parks are about to become even more incredible today with the tentative opening of much anticipated Dropline Park.  Also open for business are the other 5 parks: Boardwalk, Sidewinder, Spurline, Stomping Grounds and Upper Tote Park.  Lifts today are consistent with days past including Sawduster, Snubber, DRC East, Superquad and Skyline at 8:30am followed by King Pine, Timberline and Whiffletree at 9:00am.</p>
<p>I am anticipating a very fun day out there. Despite the cold temperatures, we are looking at mild winds and some potential sunlight today; nothing an extra layer and an extra stop into Bullwinkle’s can’t fix.</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
