<p style="text-align: justify;">Merry Christmas Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hope everyone got everything they wanted from Santa this morning! All I wanted was snow, and it appears Old Saint Nick is going to deliver the goods, with flurries today and 2-3” overnight into Sunday, and even more prospects this week. It appears for once, finally, I will not receive a sack of coal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last night our snowmakers took advantage of a cold, clear Christmas Eve and maintained operations on Widowmaker, Flume, Choker, Tohaul, Stomping Grounds, and Cruiser.  The groomers headed out on a mission to groom out all of our open terrains, plus getting Spillway X-Cut and Ramdown ready to rip, which will be opening today for some awesome sustained fall line skiing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather today calls for a new system rolling in. It should start with temperatures warming, bringing us light freezing drizzle briefly for the first part of the day, then turning into snow this afternoon and into tonight, dropping 2-3”. Otherwise, expect temps in the mid-to-upper 20s today with winds around 10-20 mph. Things will cool down slightly tomorrow with lingering snow showers that could produce another inch or two in what’s looking to be a beautiful Boxing Day. Looking down the road this week, it’s becoming more likely we are going to be impacted by a “large-scale system”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happy Holidays,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris</p>
