<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>We’ve received a couple of inches so far today and the snow continues its steady pace. The <em>Easy Wind</em> blows and there are no wind holds. <em>I know you riders</em> have been looking forward to this weekend for quite some time now. So take it easy driving up here today and remember <em>you better,</em> <em>watch your speed.</em></p>
<p>The grooming department will again be hard at work tonight tackling all of snowmaking trails and putting that snow back in place that ya’ll kicked around today from West Mountain to Haulback. The snowmaking crew will continue operations on the hill overnight keeping things running on Upper Gauge, Nitro, and Gondi extensions. Operations will continue through the weekend while we hope this natural snow does <em>Not Fade Away.</em></p>
<p>Tonight the <em>ball revolves and the nighttime calls, </em>as temps slip down to around 0 at the base. So you better go to <em>where the climate suits your clothes.</em> Tomorrow temps warm to a high of around 20 at the base, while winds elevate slightly tomorrow to the 40-20mph range. <em>The sun gonna shine in our back door</em> tomorrow leaving us with some <em>Stella Blue</em>. Temperatures drop slightly Saturday before we see a warm up on Sunday where temps will be back in the mid-20s. Snow showers and squalls are possible so let’s be <em>dancing in the street</em>s in appease the snow gods. So <em>Shine your shoes, and light your fuse, </em>because <a href="https://www.sugarloaf.com/events-calendar/fire-on-the-mountain">Fire on the Mountain</a> kicks off at 2pm with a free all age’s performance by the <strong>Skull &amp; Roses</strong> at the Widowmaker.</p>
<p><em>Settle Down Easy,</em></p>
<p>Chris</p>
