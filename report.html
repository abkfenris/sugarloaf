<p> Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> The Skiing and riding today exceeded all expectations and delivered the goods for a beautiful morning. With the holidays behind us and 2022 in its infancy, we can slip back into our comfortable routines and  continue working towards our goals. For the next 4 months, our lifts will be turning. So when you’re in the middle of the grind and feeling like you need a break. Always remember the fresh open air of the western Maine Mountains is only a car ride away.</p>
<p>With temperatures in the <em>brrr </em>category tonight the snowmakers will take advantage of ideal conditions and maintain operations on Haulback, Stomping Grounds, and Upper Tote Road. Check out our Facebook or Instagram page to scope a photos of the piles that are being made currently. The grooming team will hit the hill in force tonight and groom everything from Windrow to Widowmaker.</p>
<p>Cold temps will persist into tonight with around 3 degrees at the base and dropping to below zero at the summit. Tonight’s winds remain pretty chill in the 15-20mph range and continue into tomorrow, which looks to be another glorious sunny day of skiing and riding with temps slightly warmer in the mid-teens. Looking ahead we have a small system that will affect us starting Wednesday, which looks to be mostly light snow and flurries. More on that tomorrow morning when things come a little more into focus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Have a great night,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
