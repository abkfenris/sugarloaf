<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Be careful when traveling this morning, the roads are slick and snow-covered which means we are certainly in for another great day of snow riding at Sugarloaf. Bring your chapstick, extra layer, your best pal, and ready yourself for another great day in the Sugarloaf snow globe.</p>
<p>The grooming team last night hit a large swath of terrain from West Mountain over to Haulback. While we picked up another 4” of snow overnight. With continued strong winds, there should be plenty of powder stashes and wind drifts for the taking this morning. The morning report just came in from top of Skyline and they reported winds 40-50mph with gusts 60mph+, and Skyline will start on wind hold, as we saw yesterday that can change at any time.</p>
<p>The weather today calls decreasing clouds, temperatures ranging in the mid-teens at the base to single digits at the summit. Winds are currently blasting at the base area and are forecasted at speeds of 30-45mph with gusts to 65 at the summit. With these speed ranges being present from the NW, be prepared and open-minded to the possibility of widespread wind holds today. Remember you can always check back here at the Mountain Report or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/SugarloafSnow">@sugarloafsnow</a> on Twitter for all the latest trail and lift updates.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
