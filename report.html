<p><strong>UPDATE 2:31pm - King Pine on wind hold for the day.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</span></p>
<p>It was bit of a roller coaster of a day for lift operations.  This morning winds were high enough that only Skidway and Snubber were able to run.  After a few hours we were able to run Skyline and Superquad so it ended up being an enjoyable second half of the day for Nationals racers and pedestrian skiers alike.  Huge shout out to our wonderful Ski Patrol team for their incredible behind the scenes work determining the safety and accessibility of our lifts throughout the entire day. </p>
<p>Temperatures topped out around 30 degrees today at the base but you almost couldn’t tell with the wind which was all the more true on hill.  The snow is an interesting but fun combination of soft dry stuff and the hard fast stuff.  In other words, loose and frozen granular.  We had a great time out there as always and the Nationals racers were able to get in their first practice and event today. </p>
<p>Tonight, temperatures will stay about the same.  Some warmer air will make its way through the valley in the morning.  Winds will continue to do what they’re doing but our grooming team is determined to keep climbing the hill and getting as high as they can with the ultimate goal of grooming White Nitro whenever possible.  If they aren’t able to make it up there you can expect groomed trails to be under Spillway Crosscut only.</p>
<p>Tomorrow looks like some more of the same but the temperature will bounce back up to where it has been, 34-38 degrees at base and 25-29 at top.  Winds should actually subside a bit and we can expect partial sun so it’s very likely we will get more skiing in than we did today.  Scheduled lifts are the same 7 as today: Skidway, Snubber, SuperQuad, DoubleRunner and Skyline at 8:30am followed by Whiffletree and King Pine at 9:00am.  More Nationals racing and some awards ceremonies to check out.  Should be a fun one!</p>
<p>As I mentioned this morning, your snow dances and prayers may have been received as we look forward to a few days of expected precipitation; Thursday -- Sunday.    Thursday could bring 3-5 inches of snow followed by another potential 1-3 inches of snow/ice in the evening as things warm up.  Friday morning brings the greatest chance of rain but as it cools off into the evening we’re hoping it stays snow or at least a mix.  It should get colder the rest of the weekend with chances for flurries here and there so we could see another inch or two from snowfall on both Saturday and Sunday.  Should be fun to keep an eye on so stay tuned with your veteran reported Chris the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
