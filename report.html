<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> Congratulations to all Sugarloafers. For we have cruised through a milestone today by surpassing 100 acres of skiable terrain. This is but just a mini milestone that totals up to 16% of our total of 618 snowmakable acres. So butter you’re popcorn and grab your favorite beverage because it’s going to be a heck of a ride to the holiday season. Good news is the other 600+ acres of non-snowmaking terrain could be bequeathed to us at any given moment when Mother Nature decides to forgive us of all of our sins.</p>
<p> Our snowmaking and grooming departments absolutely crushed it this week to bring us skiing and riding off the Skyline lift this morning. Spillway was looking spectacular today with the sun cresting the tree line and illuminating the plumes of snow rocketing out of the snow guns, landing on nicely rounded mounds of snow. The snowmakers will again head out on the hill tonight and maintain operations on Spillway and the Birches. The snow kitties will once again be heading out tonight to smooth out all 18 trails over 105 acres of terrain.</p>
<p> Tonight a minor disturbance will pass through dropping up to an inch of snow. Bring your scarf with you tonight, because we are looking at temperatures in the mid to low teens, with winds in the 15mph range. As the system departs early tomorrow morning it will leave us with another wonderful sunny day, similar to today, with slightly stronger winds. Hope you all have a wonderful night and we’ll catch you back here first thing tomorrow.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note that uphill traffic is currently limited to the hours of 7:00am to 8:30am.</strong></em></p>
<p>peace out for now,</p>
<p>Chris </p>
