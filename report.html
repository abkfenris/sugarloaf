<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers and Congratulations Seth,</p>
<p>Over the weekend, two-time Olympic gold medalist and life-long Loafer Seth Wescott was honored as a member of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame’s Class of 2020!  He will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the greatest Snowboard Cross racers and most legendary Sugarloafers of all time.</p>
<p>In snow reporting news - An unfortunate day today as no main lifts were operable due to high winds.  I certainly prefer bringing good news, but I’m a man of the people and I hope I was able to give honest updates in an unfortunate situation.  If you made it out for a run or two on Snubber or Skidway, I applaud you.</p>
<p>Winds were as high as 70-80 mph today at the top of Skyline and we experienced upwards of 40 mph in the village, suffice to say it was quite windy, one of the small costs of being in such a wondrous valley.  In the form of a beautiful tease, the sun shined all day and the temperature (not including wind chill) was hovering 30 degrees.  Can’t win ‘em all. </p>
<p>Tonight temperatures on the hill will drop down to the teens.  The wind should slow some later in the night, allowing our groomers to get up high and do what they can while it’s hard and slow going.  Both shifts will get out tonight so they will be back in full force.  Schedule for tonight is to pretty up everything under Skyline, Superquad and Whiffletree for tomorrow: Cruiser, Ramdown, Widowmaker, Spillway Crosscut, Sluice, Sluice Headwall and Spillway are on the slate, White Nitro and Gondi Line won’t get hit until tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Tomorrow’s weather forecast shows similar temperatures to today and a bit less wind.  At base: 29-33 degrees, W/S 10-16 mph winds.  At top: 11-15 degrees, W 25-45 mph winds.  Mostly Cloudy.  Snow conditions should start to improve tomorrow as that rain becomes a distant memory.  As I mentioned earlier, there are some murmurs of a pretty heavy system moving in Friday/Saturday.  Just pray with me that it comes in the form of snow.</p>
<p>Passing the mic to Chris for the week.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
