<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Happy start to the new week.  This Monday, February 7<sup>th</sup> looks like it should be a great day to enjoy some turns and we may even see some more light snowfall.  Temperatures today will be 25-29 at base, 14-18 at top, winds will be S 10-16 at base, WSW 30-45 at top, and the skies will be mostly cloudy.  The wind should die down as the day goes on and we expect see some snowfall (&lt;1) going into this evening.</p>
<p>Coverage will be as good as it’s been all season this week as the storm over the weekend opened up even more new terrain.  Last night, mountain ops was out manicuring the trails and preparing Lower White Nitro for action this week.  Park crew will be working on getting Dropline Park open this week and snowmaking is still offline for the time being.  Today we will be running the weekday gambit- Snubber, DRC, Skyline, Superquad, and Skidway at 8:30am followed by Whiffletree, Skidway and King Pine now in full time operation at 9:00am. </p>
<p>This week should be a fun as we are projected for a few snow flurries here and there over the next few days so get out there and enjoy it, I know I will be.</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
