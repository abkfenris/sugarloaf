<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Skiers and riders enjoyed pockets of glorious sun in between rushing clouds today, making for some stellar scenery. This morning I was able to assist a young Bubblecuffer on the SuperQuad, and we talked about how beautiful it was today! He also told me that his dad thinks weather.com provides the best forecast, while he, on the other hand, prefers the ol' “window.com” forecast because he finds it to always be right. I’m always amazed how quickly and effortlessly young ones can put things into perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tonight snowmakers will continue operations on Stomping Grounds, Haywire, and Lower Scoot. As things start to warm and wind directions shift, they are expecting to have to shut things down for the next few days with the approaching weather; however, it appears that very cold air will start to settle in Sunday into Monday, and they’ll be able to pump it out full boar, further expanding our trail offerings. The grooming team will again be heading out to butter up all of our open terrains tonight, plus putting the finishing touches on Choker to be opened for tomorrow!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Weather tonight calls for temps in the mid-20s and moderate winds in the 15mph range. Our first round of weather starts early Thursday morning with a chance of flurries/drizzle which will continue into the day; this is a very complicated case with a lot of ins, a lot of outs, a lot of what have yous, and a lot of strands in the little dude’s head. This weather persists into the weekend, where it appears to maybe cool off and change fully to snow Saturday, so we’ll just have to rely on little old Henry’s window.com forecast in the meantime and live for the present.</p>
<p>Safe travels,<br/>Chris</p>
