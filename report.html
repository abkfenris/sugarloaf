<p><strong>UPDATE: Due to Conditions. Ungroomed terrain is recommended for expert skiers only. -8:53am</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Conditions definitely exceeded expectations today. With lots of sun, warm temperatures, and beautiful mountain scenery, it’s hard to let firmer snow dampen the spirit. Any true Sugarloafer could certainly tell you things could be way worse.</p>
<p>The grooming team will again hit the hill tonight and further aid the transition away from soft powdery snow. The park crew once again plans to have the Dropline Park open for the public tomorrow on Monday. The snowmaking team is due to come back for a final push to get Nitro and Gondi extension going. Tomorrow we will head back to a weekly lift schedule of 8 lifts starting at 8:00.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for more cold with temps dropping to around 0 at the base. Winds will remain calm overnight and into tomorrow. Monday brings another sunny day with temps in the single digits. The cold sticks around through Tuesday night when things then begin to warm up on Wednesday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
