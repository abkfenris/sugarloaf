<p>Good afternoon snow riders,</p>
<p>It was just fresh groomed out there for days this morning with roy persisting in places past 10:30. It was as though there was a corduroy stimulus package dropped this morning paid for by cold temperatures and the 9-5 work week. Try and break away from the routine and escape to get in on the mid-week corduroy surplus. If you simply just can’t make it happen I will refer you to the famous Warren Miller quote “if you don’t quit your job and move to a ski town this year. You’ll just be one year older when you do.”</p>
<p>After a generally quiet day on the mountain, the snow kitties will crawl onto the mountain tonight to freshen up all our piste terrain including the King Pine Bowl. I cannot overstate the quality of the groomed terrain this past week. Cheers to persistent cold for making this possible. Snowmakers have been enjoying some time off to get some personal mountain time in, and plan to return for the final push on Sunday.</p>
<p>The weather tonight stays the same as today except it will be dark. Looking forward to Friday high pressure moves out overnight. Clouds move in with snow showers tomorrow and temperatures warm to comfortable levels around 20 degrees. Winds are out of the Northwest in calm around the base at 15mph where things are elevated slightly in the range of 20-35mph on the upper mountain. Snow moves over the mountain mid-morning Saturday and is expected to continue into the night. Currently, winds for Saturday are forecasted at 8-15mph around the base and 20-35mph on the summit out of the Northeast. As an educated guess. If this forecast holds, we should see full lift operations for some excellent fresh snow riding Saturday afternoon, and if winds ramp up enough to see wind-holds we will have the beloved T-Bar ready for your entertainment.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
