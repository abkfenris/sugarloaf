<p style="text-align: justify;">We sent 2021 off with a bang last night and are welcoming 2022 with open arms here this morning. We picked up about an inch of new snow overnight last night, though you might not notice it by the time you arrive this morning. Temps are hovering right around the freezing mark here at the base this morning with a bit of fog and light drizzle, which should match what we're likely to see for much of the day. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We're in for a bit of a weather rollercoaster over the next 36 hours or so, with a little bit of everything headed our way. The good news though is that the bulk of it doesn't arrive until later this evening, so we should be in pretty good shape out there today. Look for temps in the mid to upper 30s, with a sporadic rain shower or drizzle here and there throughout the day. Winds are looking pretty tame throughout the day as well, and shouldn't impact lift operations. If we end up with any freezing rain or drizzle it could cause some delays, but as of this minute it's clear sailing. As always we'll keep you updated right here. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some steadier rain will move into the area this evening and today, before temperatures crash back down during the day on Sunday and we wrap this whole thing up with some snow - possibly accumulating up to 2-3 inches. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Groomers had a productive night out on the mountain last night, checking off everything on their list including Flume and Widowmaker over in the King Pine Bowl. Snow surfaces stayed nice and soft overnight, but with the changing weather you should expect a pretty wide variety of surface conditions throughout the day today. We have 10 lifts scheduled to spin for you again today, including King Pine, winds and weather permitting. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Snowmaking is offline until temps cool back down (likely Sunday afternoon), but will be back up and running as quickly as possible to keep expanding terrain in the New Year. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happy New Year,</p>
