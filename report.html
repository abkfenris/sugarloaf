<p><strong>As of 11:00am, Timberline remains on maintenance hold.</strong></p>
<p>Good Monday morning, Sugarloaf skiers and riders.</p>
<p>For those of you starting your week at Sugarloaf, temperatures are expected to stay cold through today with a range of 8 to 12 by the base and -3 to 1 at the summit, so be sure to bundle accordingly! Like I always say, layers are your best friend. Winds will be on the milder side of moderate, with gusts of up to 25 miles per hour from the W/WSW at the top and staying between 8-14 miles per hour at lower elevation terrain. Weather-wise, we expect to be taking turns under partly sunny skies.</p>
<p>In terms of terrain, we have 82 trails waiting for you today—that’s 436 explorable acres!—serviced by our 6 scheduled lifts: DRC B, Skidway, Skyline, Snubber, and the SuperQuad will start spinning at 8:30am, followed by Timberline and Whiffletree opening at 9:00am. With the semi-clear forecast in mind, I expect this Monday will be a great day for summit views, so be sure to take a lap up Timberline in your on-hill adventures today.</p>
<p>The terrain park crew continues to refine existing parks as they plan the features for the final 2 parks to open this season, Drop Line and Sidewinder. Our open parks today are Boardwalk (small), Spurline (medium), Stomping Grounds (medium/large), and Upper Tote (small/medium).</p>
<p>Overnight, our tireless team of groomers hit the hill to deliver TLC to their usual weekday roster: the usual suspects include Hayburner, King’s Landing, Ramdown, Slasher, Tote Road, and Whiffletree top-to-bottom. In other operational news, there will be active snowmaking on Competition Hill—which should make for a scenic end to your SuperQuad ride—plus Drop Line, Timberline Extension, and Upper Gondi Line. Last night, the night crew was hard at work through the wee hours blasting this terrain into a world of white; today, the day crew will continue with expansion efforts.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we expect to see some light snow showers arrive tomorrow. Cold should reset into the end of the week, with this pattern prevailing through the end of the month, and it looks like chance for substantial show comes next weekend.</p>
<p>See you on the slopes,</p>
<p>Gabby</p>
