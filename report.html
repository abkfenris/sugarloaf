<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Last night concluded another run of frigid air and we are on track for a 180-degree turn, which isn’t desirable for the ski hill but we can find solace in the possibility of lower energy bills. As of now we still remain fully open with the exception of the Burnt Mountain Terrain. Today we have 8 lifts scheduled to turn including King Pine and Timberline.</p>
<p>Last night the grooming team hit the hill and groomed many of our favorite runs. A few runs like Spillway and Sluice Chute were left off the list to allow operators to focus on quality over quantity. The snowmaking team was at it last night working on White Nitro and Gondi Line Ext. In anticipation of spring and unpredictable weather. They also are beefing up Candyside, Lower Tote, and the SuperQuad maze area.</p>
<p>Things are clear this morning and the moon shines full and bright. Some clouds will move in today giving us partly sunny skies and temps starting cold in the single digits and quickly rising to the upper twenties mid-mountain by lunchtime. Winds might become an issue today in the afternoon with speeds forecasted 35-45mph with gusts to 65 on the summit. Currently, however, speeds remain chillin and Skyline is clear to open as scheduled. We will blissfully continue to ignore tomorrows forecast until this afternoon when reality can no longer be postponed.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
