<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is the day folks. With some sun, new terrain, and an active weather pattern ahead we look to be cruising into 2022 in a classic Sugarloaf fashion. Grab your best pal and your other favorite riding goodies, and come enjoy the last day of sunny skiing we will see for a while.</p>
<p>It’s been a large but familiar puzzle putting the mountain together with minimal help from Mother Nature so far this year. Today we have connected the outer rim of the puzzle by bringing us skiing and riding off the Kingpine lift today. However we have the whole inside of the puzzle to still accomplish. Last night snowmaking pumped snow all over the mountain last night on Haulback, Stomping Grounds, Haywire, and Lower Scoot. The groomers had a busy night getting all of our existing terrain groomed, plus laying down corduroy on Widowmaker and Flume.</p>
<p>Today is the calm before the storm. We will experience partly sunny skies with some clouds rolling in ahead of our next storm. Expect temps in the mid-20s today and winds 10-15mph. Tonight will be the beginning of a long duration event that will bring every type of precipitation under the sun to our beloved Sugarloaf. Lasting until what it appears to be Sunday. Tonight through Sunday night we are likely to see light snow showers, flurries, sleet, and freezing drizzle. With much uncertainty in the forecast currently it is just too hard to tell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
