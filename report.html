<p>Rise and shine, Sugarloafers: those heading to the hill are looking at partly sunny skies for their Tuesday turns! </p>
<p>Temperatures will continue to cool today, starting at low 20s at the summit and dropping into the upper teens with mid-to-low 30s by the base, so bundle up buttercups—and don't forget the wind chill factor, which we can credit to elevated winds from the northwest.</p>
<p>We have 24 open trails for today, 14 of which will be groomed out overnight, accessible by our 5 scheduled lifts—that’s DRC B, Sawduster, Skidway, Skyline, and the SuperQuad, all scheduled to start spinning at 8:30am. In other operational news, our tireless team of snowmakers plan to get the guns going as soon as temperatures allow, so expect to see active snowmaking on King's Landing, the Chicken Pitch portion of Tote Road, Boardwalk, and Lower Scoot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Wondering what’s in store for the weekend? I know, I know, it’s only Monday, but the forecast suggests we’re due for two cold fronts, the first of which arriving Friday and the second Saturday, with much colder air expected starting next Sunday. These should be some of the coldest temperatures we’ve seen yet, </span><span>which is good news for our snowmakers—after all, at this point in the season, expanding terrain is the name of the game</span><span>. Plus, we expect to have a couple of new trails ready for first tracks on Saturday... </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Also on Saturday is our annual <a href="/events-calendar/tree-lighting-festival" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tree Lighting Festival</a>—and Santa Claus will be coming to town, accompanied by Amos and friends! Come celebrate the season in Sugarloaf style with warm treats, music on the Beach, fireworks, and more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Enjoy your afternoons,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Gabrielle</span></p>
