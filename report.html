<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Welcome to the last few days of March.  We still have a bunch to look forward to in the U.S. Alpine Championships this week with the National Championship runs for Slalom and Giant Slalom to be held tomorrow and Wednesday respectively.  If you haven’t caught any of the action yet it’s definitely worth it to get up on hill to feel the energy these racers emit for yourself.</p>
<p>The big story today, though, is snowmaking - and lots of it.  Cold temperatures allowed snowmakers to do what they do best, with over 100 guns running on Upper Tote Road, Lower Tote Road, Bridle Chain, and Lower Candyside. Snowmakers are focused on building up our base in key areas to ensure ample coverage for a lengthy spring skiing season. They'll keep things running through the day and tonight, as temperatures allow.</p>
<p>Today will be colder than days past.  Temperatures dropped into the single digits last night, and will stay significantly lower than the 40’s we’ve been experiencing seemingly every day.  Forecasted temps for today are 21-25 degrees at the base and 8-12 degrees at the top.  Expect some wind and potentially a few light snow showers on this mostly cloudy day.</p>
<p>Our incredible grooming team got to a fair amount last night- expect your favorite trails under the lifts to be nice and groomed this morning.  I’m hoping that these lowered temps are going to give some extra integrity to the corduroy and help it not get too pushed around.  7 lifts will be elevating skiers and riders today with SuperQuad, Skyline, Snubber, Skidway and DoubleRunner opening at 8:30am followed by Whiffletree and King Pine. </p>
<p>Despite what other parts of the east coast may look like, Sugarloaf still has a shocking amount of coverage.  Rip up down and around our 79 trails, 412 acres or 33 miles of open terrain today.  All signs lead to shredding.  When it comes to conditions and crowds, we are looking at a very ideal Monday.</p>
<p>Can’t wait to see you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
