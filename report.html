<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Temps remained cool today keeping things fast and sporty for our opening day of the Baxter Outdoors Reggae Fest. The first performance is tonight with a free 21+ show in the King Pine room with Reggae rockers The Equalites, starting at 9pm.</p>
<p>With cold temperatures afoot, the grooming team will be able to hit the hill tonight and groom out a wide variety of terrain for tomorrows Jah riders. Remember if you are feeling a little to irie tomorrow and forget any equipment or use a wax and a fresh edge you can always visit The Downhill Supply Company or visit the easiest of riders at the Sugarloaf Board Room.</p>
<p>The onset of this storm will start to happen anytime now. Tonight we are looking at a wintery mix with temps right around freezing at the base. Friday looks to hold the heaviest rates of precipitation, with temps in the low 30s on the upper mountain and a high temp of around 40 at the base. Winds might become an issue tomorrow with speeds ranging from 15-35mph with gusts to 55mph on the summit. With winds from the Southeast it is hard to anticipate how they will affect lift operations tomorrow. If I were to make an educated guess I would say we’ll at least have the Quad for tomorrow as winds die of into Friday afternoon and night.</p>
<p>Safe travels on the roads of creation,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
