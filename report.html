<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Wow, another incredible day.  We weren’t kidding when we said it was going to be sunny and soft all week.  This morning I rode with Noah the Groomer on King Pine for a few laps as we reaped the spoils of the work he did last night on Haulback and Ramdown.  Apparently the perfect temperature for grooming is warm, but not too warm – low 20’s or so – which is exactly what they had last night.</p>
<p>Mid-day temperatures are 36 degrees at the base and 21 degrees at the top.  Winds are pretty negligible on most of the mountain but those gusts blowing off the back of the mountain from the west kept Timberline on wind hold for part of the morning – she opened up to the public around 10:45am.  Around that same time the sun seemed to come out from behind the clouds after battling to do so all morning.  Cloud cover then dispersed tremendously to allow for a beautiful afternoon to unfold. </p>
<p>Tonight those western winds should die down a bit more and the temperature will be similar to last night with 24-28 degrees around the base and 18-22 degrees at top predicted.  Our grooming team will be working on the weekday hits and will hope to get some stuff higher up than they’ve been able to in past days.  Lifts tomorrow will be the same tenative 7 as today: Snubber, Skidway, SuperQuad and Skyline at 8:30am with Whiffletree, Timberline and King Pine following at 9:00am with Double Runner operating in the event of Timberline wind holds.</p>
<p>Weather tomorrow will stay consistent with today basically, maybe a bit warmer.  34-38 degrees at base and 23-27 at top.  Once again we have western winds that could gust as high as 40mph, but with the exception of Timberline to watch, we should be in full operation and enjoying this stretch of March warmth. </p>
<p>Further into the forecast we have this weekend to speculate about.  It looks like we’re going to see it warm up toward the end of the week with highs in the 40’s/50’s Friday that could line up with a system coming through this weekend.  I’m going to let Chris worry about that one so tune in for his reporting the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
