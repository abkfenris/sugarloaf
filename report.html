<p>Good afternoon Snow Riders,</p>
<p>Snow squalls have moved over the mountain dropping about an inch of snow so far, giving our sporty snowpack a nice whipped topping. Not only was Mother Nature showing us some love, the snowmakers also made their mark on the Mountain today leaving some nice velvet on Kings Landing and Tote Road.</p>
<p>The grooming department fought through a tough night of transforming a rock-hard snowpack into a skiable surface. Tonight they will again hit the hill hard and further refine their work on most of our on-piste trails. The snowmaking department will continue operations on Tote Road, Kings Landing, and Hayburner for a bought of resurfacing.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for more cold and elevated winds. Sunday brings warmer temps in the low 20s. Winds sustain in the strong category blowing 15-25mph at the base and 40-60 at the summit. Wind holds are likely again tomorrow. An active pattern this week again brings the hope of powder skiing and soft buttery corduroy. Make sure to stay tuned with us here at the Mountain Report for all the latest Mountain and weather updates.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
