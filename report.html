<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once again, the mountain missed any precipitation overnight, which could’ve been a blessing or a curse, depending on the type. We shall never know. However, plenty of snow exists for skiing and riding on 45 trails, thanks to our stubborn machine-made product that is incredibly resilient to Mother Nature’s worst treatments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking of, last night our snowmakers enjoyed another night off due to warm temperatures. The grooming team proceeded to hit the mountain in full force, leaving no trail ungroomed and laying down gardens of corduroy for this morning’s early birds’ delight. Today, park cat operators will be working in the new Stomping Grounds Terrain Park; you might be able to catch a glimpse of them at work today from Peavey Cross Cut or Candyside. As always, obey all closures and posted signs for everyone’s safety, and enjoy observing from a distance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weather today calls for temperatures to fall to a more normal level around 20 degrees mid-mountain. Winds remain relatively strong out of the west at 15-30mph at the base with gusts to 55 at the summit. Winds are expected to diminish tonight as cold airs begin to settle back in ahead of our next system scheduled to impact Sugarloaf. Currently, it appears the bulk of the storm will again remain south and east of Sugarloaf affecting those who are more irritated by its presence. However, we can be grateful that cold air remains in place and we are on track to receive 1-3” of snow throughout the day tomorrow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
