<p><strong>Update: Due to conditions only Skidway, Snubber, Sawduster, and Double Runner East will run today.</strong></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Undesirable weather swept over the mountain last night with warm, fog, and water droplets. A good sign however is that the Carrabassett River still remained snow and ice-covered early this morning. Which indicates the possibility that it wasn’t that bad of an event. Temps remain mild this morning and ski conditions should be soft and spring-like. With strong winds expected to persist through the day, wind holds are likely.</p>
<p>The grooming department opted to leave the snow alone to preserve surface conditions. A few operators came in this morning for a few minor touch-ups but left the hill generally ungroomed. Soon the lift department and Ski Patrol will be on the hill to assess conditions. <span style="font-size: 9pt;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt;"></span>The weather today calls for mostly cloudy skies with a chance of rain/snow showers as the system departs. Temps start warm in the 40s before trickling all the way down to the single digits tonight. Winds remain strong 20-35mph at the base and blowing 50-70mph at the summit from the Northwest. The weather down the road remains active with the possibility for systems Tuesday and Thursday next week. It’s still too early to tell what these systems might bring but it’s probably in our best interest to keep snow dancing to appease the powers that be.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
