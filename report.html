<p><strong>UPDATE: Whiffletree, King Pine on grooming hold. Timberline is on wind hold. -8:56am</strong></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>It’s one of those all hands on deck kind of mornings at the mountain because of recent weather. Even at 5:45 in the morning snowmobiles buzz about, snowcats refuel, and folks from all departments stream in to wake up Sugarloaf from a cold and icy night.</p>
<p>The grooming department has been at it since early afternoon yesterday. We were lucky to have everything freeze so early because it has given us a significant head start on grooming. Often the groomers must wait until midnight or so before things start to freeze and they can hit the hill, leaving us with only a few trails by the time lifts open. Today however we should see almost all of our on-piste trails for skiing and riding. This morning, we may experience a delay on the east side to start things off to give groomers more time to finish up. The snowmaking department his hitting the hill this morning and getting things fired up on Tote Road and Kings Landing.</p>
<p>Our trail count took a significant hit as we were forced into closing all of our off-piste terrains due to extremely icy conditions. For your safety, please obey all rope closures and posted signs. As always ski in control and look out for one another. If stopped on the side of the trail make sure to look uphill before starting and slow down and look around when entering intersections.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for partial sun and passing snow showers. Winds are forecasted to build strength throughout the day to speeds of 35-55mph on the upper mountain. However, at 6 am winds at TOS were reported at 10-20mph and Skyline was clear for opening. Temperatures will start pretty cold in the single digits before warming up in the teens today. Tonight temps drop back down and the winds persist and strengthen as we roll into Sunday. Things look active in the long-term weather pattern so let’s redouble our efforts to appease the snow gods.</p>
<p>Be Safe,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
