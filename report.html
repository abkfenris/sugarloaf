<p>And that’s a wrap. The final day of the 2021/22 season did not disappoint, with warm temps, tons of sunshine, and wall to wall corn. Many thanks to everyone who joined us today, and to the many others who joined us throughout the season. It’s been one to remember, and we’re already looking forward to next winter.</p>
<p>If you want to get a head start on next winter I have good news. The New England Pass Spring Sale deadline has been <a href="/season-passes" title="season passes">extended through Monday, May 2</a>, giving you even more time to lock in your 2022/23 season pass at the lowest rates of the year.</p>
<p>This summer is shaping up to be a busy one here at Sugarloaf, with the tee sheet at the <a href="/sugarloaf-golf-club">Sugarloaf Golf Club</a> already beginning to fill up, plus some incredible events, including the 2022 <a href="/events-calendar/enduro-world-series">Enduro World Series August 20-21</a>.</p>
<p>That’s all for winter. See you on the golf course.</p>
