<p>Good Afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The sun broke through this morning in a spectacular fashion making for a beautiful setting amongst the racing clouds. It was one of those days where you could get off the Skyline lift, turn east, hold your arms out and instantly be at the top of Gondi-Line without a single skate or pole push.  </p>
<p>The snowmakers enjoyed another relaxing day away from the harsh work environments of Sugarloaf. However, there ain’t no rest for the wicked and they are on stand-by waiting for the first sign of being able to fire up again. The plan is to head to West Mountain, Scoot, and Sidewinder. The STP cat operators are working on pushing out the gargantuan whales in Stomping Grounds and tackling the arduous task of sculpting whales into a perfectly spaced playground. I’m hoping to again catch up with them tomorrow to be able to check out their progress.</p>
<p>Tonight temps continue to drop and bottom out around the mid-teens tonight. Winds greatly diminish to the 15mph range and begin to shift direction towards the east ahead of our incoming storm due to arrive tomorrow morning around 7 am. Currently, we are still anticipating 1-3” of natural to fall throughout the day tomorrow which should lead to some pleasant riding conditions. Temps and winds remain reasonable for Friday around 20 degrees mid-mountain, with winds in the 15-35mph range coming from the South East. Looking into weather for Saturday it appears we are in for a real treat with sunny skies moderate winds and cool temperatures. We’ll catch you right here in the morning with the most up-to-date information on tomorrow’s storm.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
