<p style="text-align: justify;">Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What a beautiful day today! We had bright sun, low winds, and quick rides, with temperatures on the warmer side of seasonal. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tonight, snowmakers will continue their hard work; their plan in the overnight hours is to finish up and get out of Widowmaker, Tohaul, and Flume. Additionally, the team will try to stay on Haulback if the winds allow; they are also looking forward to getting ready to fire up the guns in Stomping Grounds, Haywire, and Lower Scoot. Meanwhile, our tireless team of Sugarloaf groomers will be back into action, pushing out all of the regular trails as well as heading over to groom Lower Cruiser down to Condo X-Cut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Temperatures are forecasted to hold steady through the night around 25 degrees at both the peak and the base. The winds should pick up a bit as clouds roll into Carrabassett Valley, delivering some light flurries before noon tomorrow morning, so make sure to come grab some fluffy flurry time on our slopes tomorrow! <a href="/passholder-hub/first-tracks">First Tracks eligible passholers</a>, take advantage of a bonus day and board Skyline or the SuperQuad starting at 7:30am tomorrow morning. We'll also be offering S'mores on the Beach from 3:00pm to 4:00pm, free for all ages and first-come, first-served; then, when the lifts stop spinning, send it over to The Widowmaker, where Jordan Kaulback will be performing <a href="/events-calendar/widowmaker-entertainment-x10537">aprés entertainment.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hope everyone has a warm, toasty night and we get to see you bright and early tomorrow.</p>
<p>Have a good night,</p>
<p>David</p>
