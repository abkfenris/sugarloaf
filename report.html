<p>Good afternoon snow riders,</p>
<p>Another day of awesome skiing is occurring in the western mountains of Maine. A couple two-tree inches of snow fell last night and this morning leaving the vibes flowing and the powder snow flying. With cold weather forecasted through the weekend, it’s definitely time to come to Sugarloaf and enjoy some prime mid-season conditions before Mother Nature experiences another mood swing.</p>
<p>The snowcats will again crawl onto the mountain tonight to level out all those soft powdery bumps that were around today and turn them into sweet and delicious corduroy for tomorrow’s early birds. They plan to hit all of our on-piste trails including the King Pine Bowl.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for another cold one with temps dropping to around 0 degrees at the base. Clouds clear out overnight leaving us with a sunny Friday. Temps will remain cold with single digits at the top and mid-teens around the base. Winds are forecasted from the NW in the range of 30-55mph. This is a similar forecast to today, so I’m optimistic we’ll see most of our lifts running tomorrow. After nice sunny days Friday and Saturday, a weather system moves in and begins to affect Sugarloaf starting Sunday. As of now, it’s looking like we’ll experience many precipitation types between Sunday afternoon and Monday night. However historically Sugarloaf sees the most snowfall in March so keep your fingers crossed.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mallett-brothers-with-elec-tickets-229861711567">Mallet Brothers Band</a> playing a live performance in the King Pine Room, <a href="https://winterkids.org/downhill-24/">the Winter Kids 24 hour downhill,</a> and Mother Nature knocking on the door early next week. There hasn’t been a better time to throw caution to the wind and cruise up to Sugarloaf this weekend.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
