<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>As this current storm starts to move out we will once again clean up in the wake of another warm-weather event. With plenty of spring still to come our way and Reggae Fest just 2 weeks away, it’s time to indulge ourselves in the golden days of the 2022 ski season.</p>
<p>Our grooming team came in at midnight and started covering the trails with corduroy. We’ll be running the same program as the last few days where you will find one or two groomed trails off of each scheduled lift. As always for your own safety please obey all closures and posted signs, they are there for a reason.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for a small chance of showers as this current system moves out of the area. Things remain warm in the upper 30s and 40s today. Skies are forecasted cloudy, but I did catch a glimpse of that large moon illuminating the whole mountain at Oh My Gosh corner on my commute this morning. So with any luck, we’ll have a few pockets of sun out there today as well. Winds are chilling around 15-30mph from the NW, so we shouldn’t have any problem running all the scheduled lifts today. The first part of the week looks sunny and windy with temps around freezing, then it looks like another storm is set to affect us for the latter half of the week that currently says “snow likely” which definitely soothes the soul.</p>
<p>Ride on,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
