<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Snow showers have turned on this afternoon and temperatures have moderated to the low teens. The trail conditions were top-notch thanks to the extreme cold and the effort from our grooming team. Tomorrow expects 7 lifts, servicing 47 trails, and 4 Terrain Parks.</p>
<p>Snowmakers battled the cold and wind this morning and got snow guns running on Upper Timberline and Sidewinder. This gets me excited for those beautiful and sunny late afternoons lapping the summit with some beer and good friends. The grooming team will hit the mountain tonight and butter all of our favorite trails for tomorrow’s skiers and riders.</p>
<p>Tonight temperatures remain in the lower teens around the base while winds diminish slightly to 15-30mph range. Tomorrow is looking to be a fantastic day with sun and a few clouds with temperatures in the mid-’20s. Wind remains moderate in the 15-35mph range from the Southeast. Cold starts to trickle back in Friday with isolated snow showers before arctic air returns for Saturday. Looking down the road it seems there is a likelihood of us receiving our first significant Nor’easter Sunday night into Monday. With the physical storm itself still off the coast of California, it is far too early to know any details besides we might be in for it, which is the best news we’ve heard for quite some time. So do you snow dances and your sacrifices to the snow gods, because we must overwhelm them with appeasement for they will never be satisfied.</p>
<p>Snow Dances…</p>
