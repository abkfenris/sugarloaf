<p>Merry afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> Those of you who got out early today for a ride will most likely agree that it was just incredible skiing and riding today. The trails were smooth, buttery, and fast. Things are only going to get better as time rolls on. Long-term forecasts are favoring a continued active pattern which is likely to bring several storms our way as we enter 2022.</p>
<p>Snowmakers are slowly getting out of operations today due to unfavorable temperatures and winds starting to set in ahead of our approaching storm. As soon as temperatures drop to favorable levels you can bet your boots they’ll be out there getting things fired back up on the east side. The grooming department will again take to the mountain and refine their beautiful work from last night. Additionally, they are going to begin the process of pushing out the gigantic whales on Skidder.</p>
<p>Tonight expect snow light snow to accumulate up to 3 inches by Sunday morning. Tomorrow things cool down slightly with lingering snow showers that could produce another inch or two in what’s looking to be a beautiful boxing day, with temps in the mid 20’s and winds reaching 30mph at the summit. With an active pattern persisting over New England it’s just a matter of time before we are plunged into the depths of winter.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
