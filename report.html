<p><span>Good afternoon, Sugarloaf skiers and riders.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Despite not getting over single digit temperatures today, it was a beautiful morning here at the Loaf: the sun and mild winds created a pleasant atmosphere that should remain until the sun sets, and with it, another bluebird day at Sugarloaf in the books.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>For those skiing tomorrow, 82 trails and 436 acres will be waiting for you! We should see a warmer and more overcast day with a range of 23-27 degrees byt he base with a span of 13-17 degrees at the summit. There's chance of showers tonight, which could result in an inch of snowfall leading into a mostly cloudy day; winds are expected to be SSE 10-16mph and WSW/SSW 20-35 at the base and top, respectively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The terrain park crew is excited to have Stomping Grounds back in action after wrapping up the Greg Francouer Bumps &amp; Jumps Event from this weekend; they also have freestyle skiers and riders on their toes as we await the final 2 Sugarloaf terrain parks, Drop Line and Sidewinder. Today’s open parks feature Boardwalk (small), Spurline (medium), Stomping Grounds (medium/large), and Upper Tote (small/medium).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Tonight, our groomers will be out there throwing down lines on their usual list of weekday trails; meanwhile, snowmaking will continue to work on blasting </span>Competition Hill, Drop Line, Timberline Extension, and Upper Gondi Line into a world of white. Looking ahead, cold should reset into the end of the week, with this pattern prevailing through the end of the month; it looks like chance for substantial show comes next weekend.</p>
