<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Sunny skies, cold temps, and several flurries and squalls the last few days have really left the mountain skiing well. The conditions around the mountain remain soft and enjoyable on and off the piste. With more cold and snow in the forecast. We will continue to enjoy superb mid-season conditions.</p>
<p>Tonight the grooming team will tackle the time-consuming task of pushing out the gigantic whales on Gondola Line, on top of grooming out all regularly scheduled trails. The snowmaking team continues a break ahead of a large storm that is anticipated to hit this weekend. Tomorrow we anticipate 6 lifts, 83 trails, over 436 acres of terrain.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for plummeting temps that will hit a low of around -7 around the base of the mountain, winds persist in the 20-35mph range. Tomorrow looks to be another wonderful day with a mix of sun and clouds and temperatures creeping into the double digits around the base and high single digits on the upper mountain. Temps continue to climb tomorrow night into Friday where we will see highs around 25 degrees with possible snow showers. Itâ€™s quite difficult to not get overly excited about a possible major storm system clobbering our mountain. However, there is consensus amongst forecasters that we have the possibility of receiving around a foot of snow between Friday night and Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Sweet Dreams,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
