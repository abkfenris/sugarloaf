<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I write this, enough snow has fallen to start covering the roads; however, it remains light enough to allow some of that brilliant moonlight streaming through the clouds to illuminate the falling flurries. With more snow forecasted for today, you can bet your toboggan that it’s a proper time to take a mental health day and enjoy some therapeutic snow sliding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Mountain Ops department was busy last night grooming the hill and blasting snow in the onward march of expansion. Last night, crews kept things running on Whiffletree and Lombard X-Cut; they are going to continue operating today as long as the winds and temperatures cooperate. Groomers headed on the hill last night to groom out all of our open terrain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today's weather calls for temperatures in the mid-to-upper 20s with the possibility of receiving 3-6 inches of snow. Winds will be moderate in the 15-40 mph range. Falling snow will mostly dominate the weather today, with a slight chance of some sleet mixing in. As snow wraps up this afternoon and day flows into night, clouds will start to decrease. We expect to see temperatures drop into the low teens and single digits across the mountain; winds will shift back around to the NW, allowing our snowmakers to continue blasting the mountain with that Carrabassett Cream.</p>
<p>Fun fact: on this day in 1884, the Amateur Golf Association of the United States was formed, later to be named the United States Golf Administration. </p>
<p>Have fun today,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
