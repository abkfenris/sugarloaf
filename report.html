<p><strong>Strong Winds are affecting lift operation. Make sure to check below for live lift status. -9:00am</strong></p>
<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>A dusting of snow fell around the base last night as temperatures cooled. Today we have 3 lifts scheduled to turn including SuperQuad, Skyline, and Double Runner. With 71 trails still open and 3 inches of snow from yesterday, you can bet that winter is still going on here in Carrabassett Valley.</p>
<p>The grooming department last night tackled trails around the central mountain. You’ll find top to bottom corduroy on Tote Road, Kings Landing, and Sluice. Currently, strong winds are impacting lift operations, and just heard a report of 40-50mph winds at the top of Skyline with stronger gusts and Skyline is starting the day on wind hold.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for overall cooler temps with highs maybe reaching 40 around the base. Today we have mostly cloudy skies with isolated rain/snow showers. Winds are forecasted in the 35-55mph from the NW. Tuesday brings another day of cloudy weather and stronger winds. However temperatures warm to the upper 40s.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
