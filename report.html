<p>Good afternoon, Sugarloafers.</p>
<p>There’s something special about waking up, looking out the window, and just getting that giddy feeling of fresh snow.  In total since last night we’ve been blessed with a somewhat unexpected 6-8 inches of snow, and it continues to fall as I type this.  Skiers and riders this morning experienced an elegant layer of natural snow that was the perfect amount to both blanket the groomers and fluff the pillows.  It really feels good to be able to lap King Pine on trails like Choker, Flume and Ripsaw with all this fresh snow over the past week.</p>
<p>Aforementioned snow is likely to continue through 7:00pm tonight while temperatures will drop down into the lower-20’s.  Sugarloaf Groomers will be hitting their normal weekday routine as well as cleaning up some of the loading areas of the chairlifts in preparation for the weekend.  Similarly, all routine weekday lifts are expected to run tomorrow.   </p>
<p>It should be another great day for skiing and riding tomorrow.  We are expecting temperatures around 23-27 at base 19-23 at top, winds of WNW 14-20 at base NW/WNW 20-40 at top and partial sun.  Another warmer day as we seem to be between two systems; the second of which brings more weather Thursday day into Thursday evening with potential for snow showers.  It’s shaping up to be a great weekend of weather here at Sugarloaf with potential for further developments so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
