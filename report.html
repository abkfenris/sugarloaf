<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> A few inches of fresh snow fell overnight leaving us blanketed with a nice layer of softness for today’s snow riding. We are falling back into that winter groove with continual snowfall and cold temperatures to preserve the soft quality of the new snow.</p>
<p>Last night the grooming department took to the hill and groomed out a ton of terrain for Maine day. You’ll find all the usual trails from West Mountain to Haulback with fresh cord. They were also able to tackle Gondi Ext and White Nitro from the summit, which offers some of the steepest skiing at Sugarloaf. You’ll also be able to enjoy the oddity of skiing corduroy on Misery Whip today, so take advantage and shred it up.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for partial sun, moderate winds from the NW in the 20-40mph. Temperatures are pleasant in the low twenties mid-mountain. Looking ahead we still yet have some cold weather to endure. Tonight another clipper brings the possibility of another inch or two of snow by tomorrow, as temps drop to around zero at the base Thursday night.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
