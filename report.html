<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The snow just keeps on coming and the continual soiree of powder skiing has our legs soar and our hearts full. With an additional 3 inches of snow today and our trail count going from 69 to 84 in just a couple of hours, todays lucky Sugarloafers scored wind drifts and pristine trails of natural snow riding.</p>
<p>Continued strong winds from the East are keeping our snowmakers from operating for another couple of days. They plan on returning to work Friday night to get things fired up on Upper Timberline, Gondi Ext, and Gondi Line. The grooming team will again tackle the mountain tonight and smooth out the usual suspects for tomorrow’s delights. Today the park crew started pushing out the gigantic snow whales on Sidewinder to start forming our Boarder Cross Terrain Park.</p>
<p>The weather tonight calls for temps in the mid-teens while winds ramp up to the 30-50mph range. Tomorrow appears to be another windy one with winds persisting in the 30-50mph range. Skies will be cloudy and temperatures hanging around in the low-to-mid teens. This cold weather will help preserve our recent precious snowfall and keep us skiing fun and soft snow. Friday looks to be another cold one with single digits and negative temperatures under sunny skies and light to moderate winds. Looking ahead things appear dry with the chance of a clipper or two bringing isolated flurries. Back to the snow dancing for now.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
