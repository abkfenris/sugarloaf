<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>If there was a spectrum to put the precipitation that is currently falling at 5:30 am it would be… oh never mind, just bring your trash bag poncho, and some extra gloves to the mountain, and you’ll be fine. If you’re out snow riding and at any point questioning your motives today just remember the belting lyrics of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju9yFA1S7K8">Janis Joplin</a> “honey, get it while you can, and don’t you turn your back on love”</p>
<p>The grooming team is in full rally mode this morning trying to get as much terrain groomed as possible before the lifts open. The cats weren’t able to get out on the hill until after midnight because the snow was too hot and sticky from the last few days. Expect 1 or 2 groomed trails off of each major lift today. Weather report coming in from Skyline has temps at 28 degrees, winds 20-30mph, and Skyline clear for operation.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for snow, sleet, and freezing rain. Groomers reported this morning at 5:30 am a snow-like material coming from the sky, while freezing rain fell on the parking lots. Temps will hover around 32 degrees and the winds will be from the SE at 20-40mph.  This disheartening weather appears to continue through Sunday afternoon when the storm rolls out and temperatures slowly trickle back down to more normal levels in the mid 20’s Sunday night. It does look like the bulk of the precip will fall today and tonight. So Sunday should be dryer.</p>
<p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
