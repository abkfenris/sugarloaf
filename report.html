<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>The winds have calmed, temperatures moderated, and a brilliant sunrise is awaking the Carrabassett Valley. With signing birds, calm winds, and sunny skies on tap for today, it is definitely a day to put the pedal to the metal, get out early, and enjoy some fresh cord.</p>
<p>The grooming team hit the hill in force last night grooming out most of our on-piste snowmaking terrain. You’ll find trails groomed from West Mountain all the way over to Haulback for todays shred fest. Remember to check below for a detailed grooming list from last night.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for mostly sunny skies, temperatures in the mid 30s, with calm winds in the 15-20mph range. As the day goes on clouds are expected to roll in as we see slight chance of snow showers this afternoon around the time are lifts are scheduled to close. Looking ahead to the first part of the week, things are looking sunny and spring like. With sunny skies, warm days, and cool nights persisting until Wednesday when we are looking at the onset of a long term precipitation event for the second part of the week into the weekend.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
