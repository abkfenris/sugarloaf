<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Thank old man winter it’s Friday because that means tomorrow we will be skiing in a snow globe. Before we get ahead of ourselves though, we have a wonderful day afoot that needs to be taken advantage of because it will only be March 11, 2022, for one day ever in all of history.</p>
<p>The grooming team tackled new terrain last night that hasn’t had any attention since our weather event at the beginning of the week. Today we will welcome back White Nitro and the entirety of Gondola Line from the summit. Some trails were unable to be completed last night so check the list below for a detailed grooming report.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for a benign day. Temperatures are nice in the upper 20s and low 30s. Winds range in speeds from 15-35mph. Skies are mostly cloudy with a chance of flurries this afternoon. Saturday brings the onset of a welcomed snowstorm that is looking to set us up with 6-10 inches of heavy snow when it’s all said and done. Keep your fingers crossed and your snow dances vibrant and lusty.</p>
<p>Enjoy Today,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
