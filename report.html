<p>Good morning jammers,</p>
<p>It's time to rise and shine, pour that mimosa, and stir up that bloody because we looking at the last day of Reggae Fest. So wring out your party outfits, compile whats left of your Reggae Fest goodies, and get yourself to the chairlift because for many of you this is your final farewell to snow riding for the season. Although the weeks following Reggae tend to bring some of the best spring skiing conditions of the season.  </p>
<p>The grooming team is currently out on the hill buffing out a variety of snow riding trails from West Mountain over to Haulback. Due our commitment to providing the best snow surface possible there is a chance we will see a delay for additional grooming in the Whiffletree and King Pine area.</p>
<p>The weather today calls for cloudy skies with a few rain/snow showers possible. Winds will remain moderate with speeds 25-45mph from the northwest. Temperatures are cooler today with temps ranging from 36-40 degrees at the base and 26-30 degrees at the summit. Looking ahead to tomorrow, Monday bring a sunny day with base area temperatures in the mid-40s with moderate winds 20-30mph and gusts to 40mph on the summit. The week ahead looks to have a few sunny days and a continued active pattern of rain and snow showers.</p>
