<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Update</strong>: Skyline remains on wind hold. -11:15am</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Good Monday morning, Sugarloaf skiers and riders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overnight our sensational snowmakers got the guns going on Tote Road, blasting it into a world of white until midnight, when they shut down to give the show a chance to dry and to allow our groomers a chance to give ’er a groom; they also took advantage of high winds and started blowing snow around the mini-pipe in Stomping Grounds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our crew was working with a short window, and since we expect to see temperatures moderate into the high 20s to low 30s at the summit today with a range of mid-to-high 30s to 40 degrees by the Base, snowmaking has gone offline for today, giving our snowmakers a well-deserved break until colder temps return (they’ll be back Tuesday, by the looks of it).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have 24 open trails waiting for you, all groomed out overnight, accessible by 5 scheduled lifts—that’s DRC B, Sawduster, Skidway, Skyline, and the SuperQuad, all scheduled to start spinning at 8:30am. Those heading to the hill will be taking turns under partly cloudy skies with elevated winds from the WNW ranging between 40 to 55 mph at higher elevation terrain; <strong>please be prepared that this may impact lift operations</strong>. Should we see holds, that information will be updated on this page as well as on our Snow Reporting Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/SugarloafSnow" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@SugarloafSnow</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Wondering what’s in store for the weekend? I know, I know, it’s only Monday, but the forecast suggests we’re due for two cold fronts, the first of which arriving Friday and the second Saturday, with much colder air expected starting next Sunday. These should be some of the coldest temperatures we’ve seen yet, </span><span>which is good news for our snowmakers—after all, at this point in the season, expanding terrain is the name of the game</span><span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Also on Saturday is our annual <a href="/events-calendar/tree-lighting-festival" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tree Lighting Festival</a>—and Santa Claus will be coming to town, accompanied by Amos and friends! Come celebrate the season in Sugarloaf style with warm treats, music on the Beach, fireworks, and more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>See you on the slopes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Gabrielle</span></p>
