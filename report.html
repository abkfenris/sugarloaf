<p>Good morning Sugarloafers</p>
<p> The snow is graciously falling making for some slippery driving condition this morning. Please Use caution coming to see us today. Greasy roads not only warrant cautious driving but they also indicate the skiing conditions are definitely worth making it to in 1 piece.</p>
<p>Last night the snowmaking crew had a pleasant night of cold temps and calm winds. They kept the guns running on Hayburner, Windrow, and the Birches. Rumor has it they have their eyes set on the. Boardwalk…, Boardwalk. The snow kitties crawled around the mountain last night freshening up all of our open terrain. Currently they are putting the final touches on Spillway, which should be available for skiers and riders at some point this morning.</p>
<p>Last night we received about an inch of snow from Mother Nature. Today expect cloudy skies, chance of flurries, with winds around 13mph at the base and gusts to 30mph at the summit. Temperatures remain on the cooler side around 20 degrees. With temperatures dropping into the teens and single digits tonight the mountain operations crew will continue on the enduring quest of expansion.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wishing everyone a safe and wonderful day,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
