<p>Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Well, today is the unfortunate reality of skiing in New England. If we didn’t have days like this, the days we had a few weeks ago wouldn’t have been so glorious and refreshing. Temperatures started dropping early AM and quickly turned saturated trails into something that is too sporty for any sort of reasonable recreation.</p>
<p>Our grooming team will hit the hill hard tonight and really show what the snowcats are capable of. It is more time-consuming to properly groom out a trail after a weather event as we’ve just experienced. From what we can tell today any natural snow trails including glades will be closed tomorrow due to icy conditions. Only groomed trails will be available and we are dedicated to getting as much terrain available as possible for Saturday. The snowmaking team will hit the hill tomorrow and begin resurfacing trails first thing. They are aiming for Tote Road and Kings Landing. With cold temps forecasted for tomorrow, we’ll be skiing the HKD velvet by mid-morning.</p>
<p>The temperatures continue their downtrend until bottoming out overnight in the single digits. Saturday things warm up to the upper teens and low twenties, while SW winds remain strong in the 30-45mph range with gusts to 55 on the summit. Skies will be sun with a few clouds and passing snow showers to give us a dusting. Sunday appears to be a similar day with partial sun temps in the upper teens and strong winds.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
