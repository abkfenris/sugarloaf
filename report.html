<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>What an incredible weekend.  After much conjecture from primarily couch-seated amateur meteorologists we ended up having pretty awesome conditions for Reggae Fest 2022.  Skiing alongside those who make the annual pilgrimage to Reggae Fest was something special, and I’ve personally never had more fun at Sugarloaf.  We’re already looking forward to Reggae 2023, but good April skiing still lies ahead for the King of Spring.</p>
<p>Temperature forecast for today is 45-49 degrees at the base, 30-34 at the top.  Wind gusts will be blowing at a similarly moderate speed to yesterday out of the northwest.  Partial sunshine is expected.  I believe this has the makings of a very mint day.  Last night we experienced some very minimal showers as well as temperatures below freezing.  The snow will likely run a bit faster today and it’ll be a pretty sight to see the work of our beloved groomers as they focused on striping up everything they could underneath SuperQuad and King Pine.  Speaking of - we are blessed with the running of King Pine today starting at 9:00am.  Already spinning will be SuperQuad, Skyline and Double Runner East at 8:30am.     </p>
<p>Looks like more of the same weather-wise ahead.  Temps will be in the 30’s and 40’s until the end of the week with chances for showers scattered throughout.  It’s really impressive how much of our snow we’ve been able to hold onto and it’s a real testament to the skill of the incredible snow teams here who work passionately to keep us having fun, safe, and making memories.  Now get up, get here and make this post-Reggae Monday a memorable one!</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
