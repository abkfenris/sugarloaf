<p>Good morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Last night’s weather is cause to reflect on what we might have done in our lives to upset our beloved mother. Fret not though snow riders, as the spirit of Jerry Garcia can be seen on the horizon his hair wild and frozen, his smile large and beaming.  He is poised to come in and <em>roll away the dew</em> for this weekend.</p>
<p>The grooming team last night operated on the hill in a very limited capacity, it really is best to just stay off the trails when they are saturated with water. Imagine squeezing a large sponge to remove all water held with it in, but then it actually never expands back to its original form and shape. They groomed the stuff around the base such as Boardwalk and the Landing. The only high trail done was Tote Road from the top of SuperQuad. The groomers are reporting strong and blustery winds, which will likely result in wind holds on the upper mountain today. Stay tuned here at the Mountain Report for updates or follow us on Twitter @sugarloafsnow</p>
<p>The weather today calls for warm temperatures in the mid 40’s and drops throughout the day. Winds are forecasted 20-35mph at the base while in the range of 50 to 70mph at the summit. The sky will be cloudy with a few showers possible throughout the day. Tonight things drop down to the single digits as strong winds persist through the overnight hours. Looking ahead to more pleasurable topics it is looking likely that we will be involved with a moderate to large scale snow storm starting Friday night and continuing into Saturday. More on that in this afternoons report.</p>
<p>Safe Travels,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
