<p style="text-align: justify;">Good afternoon, Sugarloaf skiers and riders! I've got good news: precipitation has changed from rain to snow this afternoon, with up to 5 inches of accumulation possible this evening, as temperatures continue to drop from the low-to-mid 30s to the 20s, and entering the single digits overnight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those heading to the hill tomorrow, dress for temperatures in the teens at the base with a range of 4 to 8 degrees at the summit. Temperatures are expected to remain quite cold through midweek next week, which is just what our snowmakers like to hear: the team will resume operations this evening as winds allow. We expect to see elevated winds from the NNW, with gusts up to 35 miles per hour at higher elevation terrain; these will endure through midday Monday, paired with partly sunny skies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We'll have 250 open acres for you to explore tomorrow<span>–that's 44 trails, 35 of which will be groomed out overnight, spanning 20 miles and accessible by our 6 scheduled lifts. You can count on DRC B, Sawduster, Skidway, Skyline, and the SuperQuad to open at 8:30am, followed by Whiffletree going online not-too-far-behind at 9:00am. And, as</span> always, we’ll keep you posted with the latest on conditions, terrain, and operations right here and on our Snow Reporting Twitter account, <a href="twitter.com/sugarloafsnow">@SugarloafSnow.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!</p>
