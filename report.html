<p>*<span>Ski Patrol has suspended all uphill travel for the day.*</span></p>
<p>Good Morning Sugarloafers,</p>
<p>Another warm morning with some lovely accompanying winds.  Precipitation last night was apparently snow on the mountain as opposed to rain, which is incredible.  The snow/sleet lingered into this morning but didn’t really see any accumulation. Today will likely be the coldest day this week.  Wind holds are possible with sustained 50+ mph winds expected throughout the day at the top, but as long as you ski from West to East it’s nothing but wind in the sails.</p>
<p>At the base, 25-29 degrees with WNW 15-30 mph winds.  At the top, 14-18 degrees with WNW/NW 35-55 mph winds.  Temperatures will continue to fall throughout the day as this system moves through, but thankfully we can expect some pockets of sun to shine.  6 lifts are scheduled today with King Pine and Timberline remaining closed: Superquad, Skyline, Snubber, Skidway and DRC East at 8:30am followed by Whiffletree at 9:00am. </p>
<p>Our wonderful grooming team performed the same minimalist work last night as they did Sunday night to avoid pressing down any wet, saturated snow.  It always amazes me the way they are able to move snow around and recover.  Even when Mother Nature doesn’t bless us they are able to produce such high quality work.  Same goes for Sugarloaf Terrain Park crew – yesterday parks were mostly closed to the public but I’d imagine they are more open today as they have had a chance to check everything out and make adjustments.</p>
<p>I just caught a glimpse of the extended forecast that really brightened my mood – a potential snowstorm headed our way this weekend.  I know it’s early- but anything to brighten up the mood on conditions is much needed right now I think.  More details on conditions and forecasts coming your way in the afternoon report.</p>
<p>See you out there,</p>
<p>Brady</p>
