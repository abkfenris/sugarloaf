<p> Good afternoon Sugarloafers,</p>
<p> Today just ended up being a real dandy. Calm winds, moderate temps, patches of sun, and occasional flurries made for quite the mountain experience. The inch of snow from last night played out nicely on the slopes today, giving our trails a thorough duffing. With more snow in the forecast we can anticipate another fun day of ripping on Friday.</p>
<p>Currently the snowmaking department is switching resources from Hayburner to Boardwalk. Tonight they are looking at production on Boardwalk, Windrow, Lower Scoot, with a few guns on the Landing and the Birches. The piles of snow on Hayburner were a sight to behold. The grooming team will begin pushing out the whales on Hayburner as well as heading out to recanvas all 116 acres of terrain with delightful corduroy.</p>
<p>Weather going into tonight will remain party cloudy with temperatures taking a dive into the low teens and single digits. Winds will remain reasonable in the 15-25mph range. Tomorrow looking at another small disturbance moving in during the day dropping 1-2 inches of the white stuff to further duff out your favorite trails. Temps will remain around 20 degrees and winds will increase slightly to the 20-30mph range. Going into the weekend we are watching the next system rolling in due to arrive Saturday. More on that in the morning when we have more details. Enjoy your Thursday night</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Catch you here in the AM,</p>
<p>Chris</p>
